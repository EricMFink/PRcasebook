  abstract: >-
    This detailed portrait of American lawyers traces their efforts to
    professionalize during the last 100 years by erecting barriers to control
    the quality and quantity of entrants. Abel describes the rise and fall of
    restrictive practices that dampened competition among lawyers and with
    outsiders. He shows how lawyers simultaneously sought to increase access to
    justice while stimulating demand for services, and their efforts to regulate
    themselves while forestalling external control. Data on income and status
    illuminate the success of these efforts. Charting the dramatic
    transformation of the profession over the last two decades, Abel documents
    the growing number and importance of lawyers employed outside private
    practice (in business and government, as judges and teachers) and the
    displacement of corporate clients they serve. Noting the complexity of
    matching ever more diverse entrants with more stratified roles, he depicts
    the mechanism that law schools and employers have created to allocate
    graduates to jobs and socialize them within their new environments. Abel
    concludes with critical reflections on possible and desirable futures for
    the legal profession.

  abstract: >-
    Among all those who encounter the law in the conduct of their lives or who
    consider it as a career, few have a solid understanding of the legal
    profession in America, and fewer still know anything about systems in other
    parts of the world. Lawyers in Society offers a concise comparative
    introduction to the practice of law in a number of countries: England,
    Germany, Japan, Venezuela, and Belgium.  Extracted from the editors&#39;
    three highly successful volumes Lawyers in Society, these essays guide
    readers through the differing worlds of civil and common law, law in Europe
    and Asia, and first and third world legal systems. One contribution
    addresses the changing role of women in the profession--women comprise half
    of all new lawyers in most countries--and the changes they are bringing. A
    new introduction and concluding essay reflect on the place of this volume in
    current and future research.

  abstract: >-
    Lawyer misconduct affects many people: clients, adversaries, opposing
    counsel, judges, the legal profession, and society at large. The records of
    disciplinary proceedings offer a penetrating, and largely ignored,
    perspective on how lawyers misbehave. Because the lawyers' professional
    lives are at stake, the factual records are extraordinarily detailed and the
    lawyers surprisingly open about their motivations and justifications. In
    Lawyers on Trial, Richard L. Abel presents the stories of ten California
    lawyers who broke the rules: hiring an ex-cop to chase ambulances, flouting
    fee limitations in medical malpractice cases, creating a fictitious company
    and impersonating non-existent people in order to appropriate Sega's
    computer games, a former California Real Estate Commissioner defrauding
    developers and financiers, helping a represented co-defendant negotiate a
    plea without his lawyer's participation or knowledge, and defying a judge's
    sealing order and his own client's wishes for closure in order to champion
    the "defenseless" and "oppressed" and protect "widows and children." The
    book begins by showing how nearly a century of political struggle over
    self-regulation shapes the way the disciplinary system selects and processes
    cases and concludes by canvassing reforms that could improve the performance
    of the legal profession. Lawyers on Trial will be invaluable for those
    contemplating law school, law students and teachers of professional
    responsibility, continuing legal education classes, lawyers encountering
    ethical dilemmas in their practice or trying to understand misbehaving
    colleagues, members of the public thinking of retaining a lawyer, and
    clients dealing with their own lawyers.

  title: Legal Culture And The Legal Profession
  type: book

- id: gordonAmericanLegalProfession2008
  abstract: >-
    This chapter deals with two broad topics. One is the “legal profession,” the
    formal institutions and organizations through which associations of lawyers
    seek and exercise state authority to regulate training for and admission to
    their guilds, to enforce their rules against members, and to protect their
    privileges against outsiders. The other and much broader topic is that of
    lawyers themselves, the people and occupational groups who make up to the
    profession, their work and social roles and their social standing, economic
    condition, and political influence. In the United States all lawyers have
    since the Revolution formally belonged to a single, unified profession,
    licensed by the states where they practice. There are no official ranks or
    specialties of lawyers, such as the English distinction between barristers
    (trial lawyers) and solicitors; the French among avocats, avoués, conseils
    juridiques, and notaires; or the German between the private profession of
    advocate and the public professions of civil servant, prosecutor, and judge,
    each calling for a different training, examination and career path. But in
    reality the legal profession is many, not one: a collection of occupational
    groups that work at very diverse practice tasks, enjoy very different levels
    of status and income, and play very different roles in the economy,
    politics, and society.

  abstract: >-
    What determines the systematic allocation of status, power, and economic
    reward among lawyers? What kind of social structure organizes lawyers' roles
    in the bar and in the larger community? As Heinz and Laumann convincingly
    demonstrate, the legal profession is stratified primarily by the character
    of the clients served, not by the type of legal service rendered. In fact,
    the distinction between corporate and individual clients divides the bar
    into two remarkably separate hemispheres. Using data from extensive personal
    interviews with nearly 800 Chicago lawyers, the authors show that lawyers
    who serve one type of client seldom serve the other. Furthermore, lawyers'
    political, ethno-religious, and social ties are very likely to correspond to
    those of their client types. Greater deference is consistently shown to
    corporate lawyers, who seem to acquire power by association with their
    powerful clients. Heinz and Laumann also discover that these two
    "hemispheres" of the legal profession are not effectively integrated by
    intraprofessional organizations such as the bar, courts, or law schools. The
    fact that the bar is structured primarily along extraprofessional lines
    raises intriguing questions about the law and the nature of professionalism,
    questions addressed in a provocative and far-ranging final chapter. This
    volume, published jointly with the American Bar Foundation, offers a
    uniquely sophisticated and comprehensive analysis of lawyers' professional
    lives. It will be of exceptional importance to sociologists and others
    interested in the legal profession, in the general study of professions, and
    in social stratification and the distribution of power.

    Over the past several decades, the number of lawyers in large cities has
    doubled, women have entered the bar at an unprecedented rate, and the scale
    of firms has greatly expanded. This immense growth has transformed the
    nature and social structure of the legal profession. In the most
    comprehensive analysis of the urban bar to date, Urban Lawyers presents a
    compelling portrait of how these changes continue to shape the field of law
    today.  Drawing on extensive interviews with Chicago lawyers, the authors
    demonstrate how developments in the profession have affected virtually every
    aspect of the work and careers of urban lawyers-their relationships with
    clients, job tenure and satisfaction, income, social and political values,
    networks of professional connections, and patterns of participation in the
    broader community. Yet despite the dramatic changes, much remains the same.
    Stratification of income and power based on gender, race, and religious
    background, for instance, still maintains inequality within the bar.  The
    authors of Urban Lawyers conclude that organizational priorities will likely
    determine the future direction of the legal profession. And with this
    landmark study as their guide, readers will be able to make their own
    informed predictions.

  abstract: >-
    America has long enjoyed a love/hate relationship with its attorneys; jokes
    equating lawyers with vermin abound at the same time that our love of
    litigation is reflected in a doubling of the ranks of lawyers since the
    1960s. Though we often see the lawyer as a crusading lone wolf of justice,
    the illuminating Lives of Lawyers demonstrates that the integrity of
    individual lawyers is fundamentally influenced by the nature of the legal
    organizations that have come to dominate the field. In fleshing out these
    agencies of legal expertise, Kelly offers important insights into the
    personal ideals of lawyers, the struggle to clarify professionalism as
    interpreted by the legal origination, and the effects of these factors on
    society's perceptions of law and lawyering. Lives of Lawyers paints an
    intimate portrait of five legal entities: two corporate firms, an in-house
    corporate counsel's office, and a public interest agency. Each is viewed
    through a kaleidoscope of client/colleague relationships, connections to
    civic and community life, income levels and career satisfaction of
    attorneys, the social status of the organization, and the character of the
    particular law practiced. These detailed portrayals vividly reveal the
    diversity inherent to the profession and the wealth of responses to the
    question of what shapes the values of today's legal practices. The author's
    deft use of narrative and debt to the discipline of biography and sociology
    make his five stores a first-rate read. Kelly gets into the trenches with
    lawyers comprising these organizations; they don't mince words in passing
    judgment on themselves, their employers, or the state of the
    profession--particularly its growing commercialism. Nonetheless, Lives of
    Lawyers reminds us of the constantly renewed dedication by lawyers to the
    principles of legal professionalism. Michael J. Kelly is University Vice
    President and Professor of Law, Georgetown University.

    The past two decades have seen profound changes in the legal profession.
    Lives of Lawyers Revisited extends Michael Kelly’s work in the original
    Lives of Lawyers, offering unique insights into the nature of these changes,
    examined through stories of five extraordinarily varied law practices. By
    placing the spotlight on organizations as phenomena that generate their own
    logic and tensions, Lives of Lawyers Revisited speaks to the experience of
    many lawyers and anticipates important issues on the professional horizon.
    "Michael Kelly has done it again! His Lives of Lawyers Revisited is a very
    easy read about some very difficult notions like 'litigation blindness' and
    law as a business. It presents some fascinating perspectives on our
    profession." —J. Michael McWilliams, Past President, American Bar
    Association "The best single book about the American realities and
    possibilities of the American legal profession, combining an empathic and
    insightful account of law practice with a penetrating analysis of the wider
    context of professional work." —Marc Galanter, University of Wisconsin
    "Michael Kelly believes that professional values and conduct are not
    realized in codes, but in the experiences of practice, and that practice
    draws its routines and ideals from organizations. Through his studies of
    lawyers in various firms, closely observed and sympathetically described,
    Kelly reveals how differently organizations adapt to the intense pressures
    of today's practice environment. His method of linking individual
    life-experiences to organizational strategies and the external constraints
    of competition and client demands infuses realism and richness into the
    concept of professionalism and makes this one of the most interesting and
    original books on professions and professionalism to appear in years."
    —Robert W. Gordon, Yale Law School "In his two volumes of Lives of Lawyers,
    Michael Kelly explores legal ethics in an unusual, and unusually rewarding,
    way. Rather than focusing on rules or arguments, Kelly looks at the kind of
    lives lawyers lead. Ethics, Socrates thought, is about how to live one's
    life, and Kelly takes the Socratic question to heart. He explores the
    institutions lawyers work in and the choices they make. He writes with
    intelligence, great insight, and above all with heart. This is a superb
    book." —David Luban, Georgetown University Michael J. Kelly is President and
    Chairman of the Board of the National Senior Citizens Law Center, an
    advocacy group for older Americans of limited means.

  abstract: >-
    How do lawyers resolve ethical dilemmas in the everyday context of their
    practice? What are the issues that commonly arise, and how do lawyers
    determine the best ways to resolve them? Until recently, efforts to answer
    these questions have focused primarily on rules and legal doctrine rather
    than the real-life situations lawyers face in legal practice.  The first
    book to present empirical research on ethical decision making in a variety
    of practice contexts, including corporate litigation, securities,
    immigration, and divorce law, Lawyers in Practice fills a substantial gap in
    the existing literature. Following an introduction emphasizing the
    increasing importance of understanding context in the legal profession,
    contributions focus on ethical dilemmas ranging from relatively narrow
    ethical issues to broader problems of professionalism, including the
    prosecutor’s obligation to disclose evidence, the management of conflicts of
    interest, and loyalty to clients and the court. Each chapter details the
    resolution of a dilemma from the practitioner’s point of view that is, in
    turn, set within a particular community of practice. Timely and practical,
    this book should be required reading for law students as well as students
    and scholars of law and society.

    Lawyers Crossing Lines is a collection of true stories about lawyers from
    all segments of the legal profession who transgressed ethical boundaries.
    Most of them ended up being sanctioned by their state Bar, sued for
    malpractice, prosecuted, or some combination of all three. All of the cases
    are rich in detail, many are bizarre, and in a few the attorney's conduct is
    so outrageous as to stretch the reader¿s credulity. Each tale is followed by
    comments and questions designed to explore the issues in greater depth. This
    diminutive but captivating volume is intended as a supplemental text for
    students in professional responsibility courses at American law schools. It
    can also be used as the foundation for an advanced seminar in ethics. It is
    based on the proposition that, although the rules of professional
    responsibility are, of course, of supreme importance, sometimes the study of
    them can be monotonous and dry. More important, students -- none of whom
    have been in law practice and most of whom have never been out in the
    working world -- often find it hard to believe that the rules can be so
    easily and egregiously broken. These real world scenarios bring the ethical
    quandaries faced in everyday legal practice to life. The stories come from
    all segments of the legal profession and make fascinating and memorable
    reading. No other book on the market takes this narrative approach, making
    this an important and unique contribution to the field.

    When the first volume of Morton Horwitz's monumental history of American law
    appeared in 1977, it was universally acclaimed as one of the most
    significant works ever published in American legal history. The New Republic
    called it an "extremely valuable book." Library Journal praised it as
    "brilliant" and "convincing." And Eric Foner, in The New York Review of
    Books, wrote that "the issues it raises are indispensable for understanding
    nineteenth-century America." It won the coveted Bancroft Prize in American
    History and has since become the standard source on American law for the
    period between 1780 and 1860. Now, Horwitz presents The Transformation of
    American Law, 1870 to 1960, the long-awaited sequel that brings his sweeping
    history to completion.  In his pathbreaking first volume, Horwitz showed how
    economic conflicts helped transform law in antebellum America. Here, Horwitz
    picks up where he left off, tracing the struggle in American law between the
    entrenched legal orthodoxy and the Progressive movement, which arose in
    response to ever-increasing social and economic inequality. Horwitz
    introduces us to the people and events that fueled this contest between the
    Old Order and the New. We sit in on Lochner v. New York in 1905--where the
    new thinkers sought to undermine orthodox claims for the autonomy of
    law--and watch as Progressive thought first crystallized. We meet Oliver
    Wendell Holmes, Jr. and recognize the influence of his incisive ideas on the
    transformation of law in America. We witness the culmination of the
    Progressive challenge to orthodoxy with the emergence of Legal Realism in
    the 1920s and '30s, a movement closely allied with other intellectual trends
    of the day. And as postwar events unfold--the rise of totalitarianism
    abroad, the McCarthyism rampant in our own country, the astonishingly
    hostile academic reaction to Brown v. Board of Education--we come to
    understand that, rather than self-destructing as some historians have
    asserted, the Progressive movement was alive and well and forming the roots
    of the legal debates that still confront us today. The Progressive legacy
    that this volume brings to life is an enduring one, one which continues to
    speak to us eloquently across nearly a century of American life. In telling
    its story, Horwitz strikes a balance between a traditional interpretation of
    history on the one hand, and an approach informed by the latest historical
    theory on the other. Indeed, Horwitz's rich view of American history--as
    seen from a variety of perspectives--is undertaken in the same spirit as the
    Progressive attacks on an orthodoxy that believed law an objective, neutral
    entity. The Transformation of American Law is a book certain to revise past
    thinking on the origins and evolution of law in our country. For anyone
    hoping to understand the structure of American law--or of America
    itself--this volume is indispensable.
