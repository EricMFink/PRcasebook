**3.1: Fiduciary Duties**

Attorneys are fiduciaries of their clients. As fiduciaries, they have
certain legal duties to their clients, which include:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</tbody>
</table>

The duties of care, loyalty, impartiality, and confidentiality attach
whenever an attorney-client relationship begins and may continue after
an attorney-client relationship ends. Accordingly, attorneys may owe
duties to both current and former clients, which may affect an
attorney’s ability to continue representing those clients or to
represent new clients.

**The Duty of Care**

Attorneys must exercise reasonable care when representing their clients.
Typically, courts expect attorneys to use the degree of care expected of
an ordinary attorney in similar circumstances. In other words, the duty
of care imposed on an attorney is a duty of professional care,
reflecting the expectations of both the client and other attorneys. An
attorney who fails to exercise reasonable care is negligent, and may be
liable in tort for malpractice. Attorneys may have a duty of care to
both current and former clients, and any negligent act in relation to
representation of a client may create a malpractice claim.

In order to prove a legal malpractice claim for a breach of the duty of
care, the plaintiff must show:

1.  The existence of a duty of care,

2.  A breach of the duty of care by the defendant, and

3.  Harm to the plaintiff caused by the breach.

A duty of care exists only if an attorney-client relationship exists.
Accordingly, the first element of a malpractice claim for breach of the
duty of care requires the plaintiff to prove the existence of an
attorney-client relationship. The second element requires the plaintiff
to prove that the defendant’s actions or omissions breached the duty of
care. Typically, an attorney breaches the duty of care by providing
negligent legal advice or by negligently failing to act in the client’s
interests. The third element requires the plaintiff to prove that the
defendant’s breach of the duty of care caused harm to the plaintiff.
Like any other tort, a plaintiff can recover on a legal malpractice
action claim only if the malpractice caused harm, and only to the extent
of the harm.

**The Duty of Loyalty**

Attorneys are fiduciaries of their clients because clients justifiably
vest confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in their attorneys.
Accordingly, attorneys have a fiduciary duty to maintain an undivided
loyalty to their clients at all times. Attorneys must ensure that their
duties to their clients never conflict with their own financial
interests, the interests of another client, or any other interest that
would affect their ability to provide competent and diligent
representation.

Under the duty of loyalty, attorneys cannot represent anyone with an
interest adverse to one of their clients, because it would create a
conflict of interest. If that interest becomes an issue, the attorney’s
loyalty would be divided between the two clients. Obviously, an attorney
cannot represent two parties with interests directly adverse to each
other, like opposing parties in litigation, because the conflict of
interest is fundamental and unavoidable. [M.R. 1.7, cmt.
\[8\]](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_7_conflict_of_interest_current_clients/comment_on_rule_1_7/).
But the restriction imposed by the duty of loyalty applies more broadly.
Any adverse or potentially adverse interest may create a conflict of
interest, even if that interest is not yet at issue.

**The Duty of Impartiality**

As fiduciaries of their clients, attorneys have a duty to provide candid
and impartial advice. In order to satisfy the duty of impartiality,
attorneys must be able to exercise their independent professional
judgment, without any conflicts of interest. If a client’s interests are
adverse or potentially adverse to the attorney’s interests or the
interests of another client, a conflict of interest exists that will
compromise the attorney’s impartiality. Under those circumstances,
attorneys will have an incentive to provide advice that benefits
themselves or their other clients, and withhold advice that does not.
Even if the client is not harmed by the advice itself, the client is
harmed by not receiving candid and impartial advice reflecting the full
range of available options.

For example, if an attorney represents a client in a contract
negotiation, and the outcome of the negotiation could affect the
interests of another client, a conflict of interest exists, because the
attorney has an incentive to provide advice that will benefit the first
client and withhold advice that will harm the second client. Even if the
advice benefits both clients, the client receiving the advice is harmed
by not receiving candid and impartial advice. Likewise, if an attorney
both represents and has a financial interest in a corporation, a
conflict of interest exists, because the attorney has an incentive to
provide advice that will benefit the attorney’s investment and withhold
advice that will not, depriving the client of the full range of options.

</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

**The Duty of Confidentiality**

As fiduciaries of their clients, attorneys also have a duty to maintain
the confidentiality of private information disclosed to them by their
clients. Under the duty of confidentiality, attorneys must never
disclose confidential client information to a third party not bound by
the duty of confidentiality or use confidential client information to
benefit themselves or another client. Clients are entitled to confide in
their attorney, secure in the knowledge that the confidential
information they disclose cannot be used against them.

If a client’s interests are adverse or potentially adverse to the
attorney’s interests or the interests of another client, a conflict of
interest exists that will compromise the attorney’s ability to maintain
confidentiality. Under those circumstances, attorneys have an incentive
to use the confidential information for their own benefit or the benefit
of their other client. Even if the client is not harmed by the use of
the confidential information, the client is harmed by the betrayal of
trust.

**Limitations on the Duties of an Attorney**

While the absolute duties of loyalty, impartiality, and confidentiality
are the quintessence of professional responsibility, they are not always
enforced to the letter. Taken literally, they would inevitably preclude
attorneys from ever representing more than one client. It is always
possible that the interests of a potential client will conflict with
those of a current client. It is always possible that advice given to
one client will affect the interests of another client. And it is always
possible that confidential information disclosed by one client will be
relevant to another. In practice, the duties of an attorney must yield
to the practical realities of representation.

Accordingly, the duties of attorneys are shaped by the rights of
<u>clients</u>, <u>attorneys</u>, and the <u>bar</u>.

- Clients are entitled to hire the attorney of their choice, and may
    > consent to representation, despite a formal conflict.

- Attorneys are entitled to represent more than one client, so long as
    > they disclose any conflicts and the client consents.

- The bar is entitled to prevent parties from using conflicts
    > strategically to disqualify opposing counsel.

In other words, clients may provide informed consent to certain
conflicts of interest. Attorneys may represent clients with conflicts of
interests under certain circumstances, so long as the clients provide
informed consent. And under certain circumstances, the bar may even
permit attorneys to represent parties with conflicting interests without
consent.

However, attorneys must *always* observe the **duty of care**. An
attorney who fails to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances
is negligent and potentially liable for malpractice, even if the client
consents.

This is a legal malpractice action in which the plaintiff-client appeals
from a summary judgment granted the defendant-attorney. The factual
narrative will possess heightened significance against a backdrop of
general doctrine:

> Actionable legal malpractice is compounded of the same basic elements
> as other kinds of actionable negligence: duty, breach of duty,
> proximate cause, damage. Touching the first element, duty, the general
> rule is that “the attorney, by accepting employment to give legal
> advice or to render other legal services, impliedly agrees to use such
> skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and
> capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks
> which they undertake.”

In this case the defense is that the client sought no advice from the
attorney and was given none; by the client's express admission, she did
not rely on the attorney, thus, that her alleged damage was not
proximately caused by the attorney's cause of action.

The facts are presented by summary judgment affidavits, which include
extracts from depositions. There is no significant conflict in the
evidence. Roberta Ishmael, the plaintiff, was formerly married to Earl
F. Anders. The couple had three children. They lived in Gridley, where
Mr. Anders was a partner in a family trucking business. Domestic
difficulties resulted in a separation, and Mrs. Anders moved to
Sacramento where she secured employment. She and her husband agreed upon
a divorce and property settlement. She knew that she was entitled to
one-half the marital property.

Mr. Anders called upon defendant Robert Millington, a Gridley attorney
who had for some time represented him and his trucking firm. Mr.
Millington advised Anders that if he could establish adulterous conduct
by Mrs. Anders, he might be awarded more than one-half the community
property. For one reason or another there was a decision that the wife
rather than the husband would apply for divorce. At Anders’ request Mr.
Millington agreed to act as the wife's attorney, to prepare the
necessary papers and to file a divorce action for her. He drew up a
complaint and a property settlement agreement and handed these documents
to Mr. Anders, who took them to Sacramento and had his wife sign them.
She knew that Mr. Millington had represented her husband in the past.
Faulty recall prevents ascertainment whether Mrs. Anders ever met
personally with the attorney before the papers were drawn. She did not
discuss the property settlement agreement with the attorney before she
signed it. Mr. Millington believed the divorce and property settlement
arrangements were “cut and dried” between the husband and wife; he
“assumed that she knew what she was doing;” he believed that she was
actually getting half the property but made no effort to confirm that
belief.

In her deposition the former Mrs. Anders testified that in signing the
complaint and property settlement agreement she relied solely on her
husband and did not rely on the attorney. Later, when so instructed, she
traveled to the courthouse at Oroville, where she and her corroborating
witness met Mr. Millington. He escorted her through a routine ex parte
hearing which resulted in an interlocutory divorce decree and judicial
approval of the property settlement.

According to her complaint, the former Mrs. Anders discovered that in
return for a settlement of $8,807 she had surrendered her right to
community assets totaling $82,500. Ascribing her loss to the attorney's
negligent failure to make inquiries as to the true worth of the
community property, she seeks damages equivalent to the difference
between what she received and one-half the asserted value of the
community.

By the very act of undertaking to represent Mrs. Anders in an
uncontested divorce suit, Mr. Millington assumed a duty of care toward
her, whatever its degree. Described in terms traditionally applicable to
the attorney-client relationship, the degree of care exacted by that
duty was that of a figurative lawyer of ordinary skill and capacity in
the performance of like tasks.

The degree of care is related to the specific situation in which the
defendant found himself. The standard is that of ordinary care under the
circumstances of the particular case. A lawyer owes undivided loyalty to
his client. Minimum standards of professional ethics usually permit him
to represent dual interests where full consent and full disclosure
occur. The loyalty he owes one client cannot consume that owed to the
other. Most descriptions of professional conduct prohibit his
undertaking to represent conflicting interests at all; or demand that he
terminate the three-way relationship when adversity of interest appears.
Occasional statements sanction informed representation of divergent
interests in “exceptional” situations. Even those statements demand
complete disclosure of all facts and circumstances which, in the
attorney's honest judgment, may influence his client's choice, holding
the attorney civilly liable for loss caused by lack of disclosure.

Divorces are frequently uncontested; the parties may make their
financial arrangements peaceably and honestly; vestigial chivalry may
impel them to display the wife as the injured plaintiff; the husband may
then seek out and pay an attorney to escort the wife through the
formalities of adjudication. We describe these facts of life without
necessarily approving them. Even in that situation the attorney’s
professional obligations do not permit his descent to the level of a
scrivener. The edge of danger gleams if the attorney has previously
represented the husband. A husband and wife at the brink of division of
their marital assets have an obvious divergence of interests.
Representing the wife in an arm’s length divorce, an attorney of
ordinary professional skill would demand some verification of the
husband’s financial statement; or, at the minimum, inform the wife that
the husband's statement was unconfirmed, that wives may be cheated, that
prudence called for investigation and verification. Deprived of such
disclosure, the wife cannot make a free and intelligent choice.
Representing both spouses in an uncontested divorce situation (whatever
the ethical implications), the attorney’s professional obligations
demand no less. He may not set a shallow limit on the depth to which he
will represent the wife.

The general standard of professional care is appropriate to the garden
variety situation, where the attorney represents only one of several
parties or interests. It falls short of adequate description where the
attorney's professional relationship extends to two clients with
divergent or conflicting interests in the same subject matter. A more
specific statement of the same rule is needed to guide the fact trier to
the law's demands when the attorney attempts dual representation. In
short, an attorney representing two parties with divergent interests
must disclose all facts and circumstances which, in the judgment of a
lawyer of ordinary skill and capacity, are necessary to enable his
client to make free and intelligent decisions regarding the subject
matter of the representation.

In view of the degree of care imposed by law on an attorney in
defendant's position, a fact trier might reasonably find him negligent
in failing to disclose to plaintiff the limited representation she was
receiving and in failing to point to the possibility of independent
legal advice. The question of breach was thus a triable issue which
could not be resolved on a summary judgment motion.

Legal malpractice may consist of a negligent failure to act. The
attorney's negligence, whether consisting of active conduct or a failure
to act, need not be the sole cause of the client's loss. Here the
attorney is charged not with erroneous advice, but with failure to
advise, failure to investigate, failure to disclose. The wife's reliance
on her husband’s alleged misrepresentations is not at all inconsistent
with the claim that her loss was the result of the attorney's negligent
failure. A jury might find that the husband's misrepresentations were a
realizable likelihood which made the attorney's inaction negligent, thus
forming a concurrent (and not superseding) cause of harm. Causation was
a jury question which could not be resolved as a matter of law.

Contributory negligence on plaintiff's part was specially pleaded and,
if established, would bar malpractice recovery. Plaintiff, as she
testified, relied on her husband's list of assets; apparently did not
trouble to investigate or even to inquire whether she was getting her
share of property; was seemingly content to let her husband take charge;
accepted his attorney for the limited purpose of piloting her through
the divorce formalities. A court, however, cannot say that reasonable
jurors would inevitably characterize her conduct as contributory
negligence. That issue was a triable issue of fact.

Thus, notwithstanding the lack of conflict in the evidence, the summary
judgment rests on the determination of issues reserved for decision by a
fact trier and which could not be resolved as a matter of law. Since
triable issues of fact existed, the motion should have been denied.

**The Appearance of Impropriety**

*Let this, my young Readers, be your constant Maxim, That no Man can be
good enough to enable him to neglect the Rules of Prudence; nor will
Virtue herself look beautiful, unless she be bedecked with the outward
Ornaments of Decency and Decorum.*[1]

The ABA has long held that judges should avoid “the appearance of
impropriety.” When the ABA adopted the Canons of Judicial Ethics in
1924, Canon 4 held that judges should avoid “the appearance of
impropriety.” When it adopted the Code of Judicial Conduct in 1972,
Canon 2 held that a judge should avoid “the appearance of impropriety in
all his actions.” When it adopted the Model Code of Judicial Conduct in
1990, Canon 2A maintained the appearance of impropriety standard,
holding that “the test for the appearance of impropriety is whether the
conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge's
ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with integrity,
impartiality and competence is impaired.” And Rule 1.2 of the revised
Model Rules of Judicial Conduct retains the same standard.

But lawyers have resisted applying the appearance of impropriety
standard to themselves. When the ABA adopted the Model Code of
Professional Responsibility in 1969, it included the appearance of
impropriety standard only as an “ethical consideration,” rather than a
“disciplinary rule,” making it aspirational, rather than mandatory. And
when the ABA adopted the Model Rules of Professional Conduct in 1983, it
eliminated the appearance of impropriety standard entirely.

**Model Code of Professional Responsibility**

**Canon 9: A Lawyer Should Avoid Even the Appearance of Professional
Impropriety**

**Ethical Consideration 9-2**

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Board of Education of the City of New York used separate seniority lists when deciding layoffs of male and female Health and Physical Education teachers (“HPETs”). The Commissioner of Education held that using separate lists was illegal, but the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare disagreed, arguing that merging the lists would violate Title IX by disproportionately affecting women. The Board filed a declaratory judgment action against three male and three female HPETs. The male HPETs were represented by James R. Sandner of New York State United Teachers. The female HPETs filed a motion to disqualify Sandner, on the ground that their union dues helped pay for his services.

This unusual case presents difficult questions regarding the appropriate
role of federal courts when called upon by disqualification motions to
evaluate the conduct of attorneys who appear before them. Three male
Health and Physical Education teachers (HPETs) in the New York City
school system appeal from an order of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, disqualifying their counsel upon
the motion of three female HPETs. Appellant male teachers claim that the
order was an abuse of discretion because it disregarded their
constitutional rights, and was without any sound basis. For reasons set
forth below, we hold that the motion to disqualify should have been
denied, and we therefore reverse the order of the district court.

The contending parties on appeal - the male and female HPETs - are all
defendants in this declaratory judgment action brought by the Board of
Education of the City of New York and the Chancellor of the City School
District. In February 1977, these plaintiffs found themselves in the
middle of apparently contradictory positions held by the Commissioner of
Education of the State of New York and the office of Civil Rights of the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). In a case involving
one of these appellants, the State Commissioner had ruled that the use
of separate seniority lists for male and female HPETs for the purpose of
layoffs was illegal. Shortly thereafter, HEW initially indicated to the
Board that HEW took exactly the contrary view, that merger of the lists
would violate Title IX. Caught in this apparent dilemma, plaintiffs
provisionally merged the seniority lists of male and female HPETs and
commenced this action for a declaratory judgment in which all concerned
parties would be present. The complaint named as defendants HEW and its
Secretary, the New York State Commissioner of Education, the State
Division of Human Rights, three named male HPETs, individually and as
representatives of all male HPETs, and three named female HPETs,
individually and as representatives of all female HPETs. The male and
female defendants have asserted counterclaims and cross-claims. The
relief sought by plaintiffs is a judgment declaring that the provisional
policy of merging the seniority lists, effective February 1, 1977 but
not retroactively, is lawful.

The two classes of defendants are the actual contending parties in this
litigation. The male HPETs allege that maintaining separate seniority
lists for male and female HPETs is illegal and that:

> all defendant male Health and Physical Education teachers who were
> laid off on or after September 1, 1975, are entitled to reinstatement
> with back pay and all other retroactive benefits incident to their
> positions to the date of their layoff if less senior female teachers
> were retained at that time or at any time thereafter.

The female HPETs allege that their seniority status perpetuates past
discriminatory practices of plaintiffs and that if the provisional
merged seniority list is used for layoff purposes “it will result in the
layoff of at least six times as many female HPETs as male HPETs.” The
stakes in the lawsuit are obviously high.

The male HPETs are represented in this action by James R. Sandner, Esq.,
who is also General Counsel of New York State United Teachers (NYSUT).
That organization is an unincorporated membership association of
approximately 180,000 teachers, librarians, guidance counsellors and
other school related employees of the almost 800 school districts in New
York State. We are told that in each of the school districts there is a
separate local union, which is the exclusive bargaining representative
for employees in that unit. The majority of these individual unions have
chosen to affiliate themselves with NYSUT, but the latter does not
collectively bargain for any public employees. It does, however, provide
a number of services to its members, including a legal service program
under the direction and control of Mr. Sandner. Both the male and female
HPETs are represented in collective bargaining by the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT), to whom they pay dues. A portion of the
dues paid to the AFT is remitted to NYSUT, which, at least in part,
apparently finances the legal service program.

Under the program, NYSUT’s members may apply to obtain legal
representation free of charge. Mr. Sandner and his staff may take an
applicant's case when, in their judgment, the claim is both job-related
and meritorious. It is through this procedure that the male defendants
retained Mr. Sandner as their attorney. NYSUT itself, however, has taken
no position on the merits or on any other issue in this litigation.

The female HPETs moved to disqualify Mr. Sandner as counsel for the male
HPETs or, in the alternative, to require NYSUT to furnish counsel for
the female teachers. Judge Lasker concluded that “the female teachers
are paying, in part, for their opponents’ legal expenses.” This violated
“at least the spirit, if not the letter, of Canon 9 of the Code of
Professional Responsibility that ‘A lawyer should avoid even the
appearance of impropriety.’” Accordingly, the judge granted the motion
and this appeal by the male HPETs followed.

We begin the discussion by noting that, curiously, the power of the
federal courts to disqualify attorneys in litigation pending before them
has long been assumed without discussion, and attention has focused on
identifying the circumstances in which exercise of the power is
appropriate. Our reading of the cases in this circuit suggests that we
have utilized the power of trial judges to disqualify counsel where
necessary to preserve the integrity of the adversary process in actions
before them. In other words, with rare exceptions disqualification has
been ordered only in essentially two kinds of cases: (1) where an
attorney's conflict of interests in violation of Canons 5 and 9 of the
Code of Professional Responsibility undermines the court’s confidence in
the vigor of the attorney's representation of his client, or more
commonly (2) where the attorney is at least potentially in a position to
use privileged information concerning the other side through prior
representation, for example, in violation of Canons 4 and 9, thus giving
his present client an unfair advantage. In such cases, we note Chief
Judge Kaufman's oft-quoted admonition that,

> When dealing with ethical principles, we cannot paint with broad
> strokes. The lines are fine and must be so marked. Guideposts can be
> established when virgin ground is being explored, and the conclusion
> in a particular case can be reached only after a painstaking analysis
> of the facts and precise application of precedent.

But in other kinds of cases, we have shown considerable reluctance to
disqualify attorneys despite misgivings about the attorney's conduct.
This reluctance probably derives from the fact that disqualification has
an immediate adverse effect on the client by separating him from counsel
of his choice, and that disqualification motions are often interposed
for tactical reasons. And even when made in the best of faith, such
motions inevitably cause delay. For example, this lawsuit has been at a
standstill now for close to a year.

Weighing the needs of efficient judicial administration against the
potential advantage of immediate preventive measures, we believe that
unless an attorney's conduct tends to “taint the underlying trial” by
disturbing the balance of the presentations in one of the two ways
indicated above, courts should be quite hesitant to disqualify an
attorney. Given the availability of both federal and state comprehensive
disciplinary machinery, there is usually no need to deal with all other
kinds of ethical violations in the very litigation in which they
surface.

With these thoughts in mind, we turn to the ethical problems presented
by the instant appeal. The district court disqualified Mr. Sandner
because a “layman's faith would be severely troubled” by the fact that
“the female teachers are paying, in part, for their opponents' legal
expenses.” There is no claim, however, that Mr. Sandner feels any sense
of loyalty to the women that would undermine his representation of the
men. Nor is there evidence that his representation of the men is
anything less than vigorous. There is also no claim that the men have
gained an unfair advantage through any access to privileged information
about the women. Were there any such problem, the women would not be
asking, and the district judge would not have ordered, as an alternative
to disqualification of Mr. Sandner, that NYSUT pay their attorney's
fees. Thus, in no real sense can Mr. Sandner's representation of the men
be said to taint the trial.

We agree that there is at least some possibility that Mr. Sandner's
representation of the men has the appearance of impropriety, because of
the large number of union members involved and the public importance of
the civil rights issue at the heart of the dispute. But in any event, we
think that disqualification was inappropriate. We believe that when
there is no claim that the trial will be tainted, appearance of
impropriety is simply too slender a reed on which to rest a
disqualification order except in the rarest cases. This is particularly
true where, as in this case, the appearance of impropriety is not very
clear. We note that while on one hand there is an element of unfairness
to the women, on the other it seems probable that if NYSUT were to take
a position on the merits of this litigation, Mr. Sandner's
representation of the men would apparently be within the protection of
the "fair representation" cases. This means that the question whether
Mr. Sandner's conduct is unethical could be a very close one. Since
disqualification entails immediate disruption of the litigation, it is
better to relegate any questions about Mr. Sandner's conduct to other
appropriate proceedings. In addition to the possibility of grievance
proceedings and an internal union attack on the legal plan, it may be
that judicial construction of the plan, in an appropriate lawsuit, could
provide some relief for the women.

We therefore reverse the order of the district court disqualifying
counsel, and remand for continuation of the action.

A visit by a judicial officer to a special facility for sexually violent
predators is not in itself inappropriate conduct under the Code of
Judicial Conduct. However, conversations with the residents of the
facility concerning the reasons for their confinement, particularly when
one or more of these residents has a matter or matters pending before
the court on which the judge sits, can violate the Code of Judicial
Conduct. By asking questions of inmates who were litigants or should
have been recognized as potential litigants on issues currently pending
before the court, Justice Richard B. Sanders violated the Code of
Judicial Conduct. His conduct created an appearance of partiality as a
result of ex parte contact.

The Washington Commission on Judicial Conduct received a complaint on
March 18, 2003, regarding Justice Sanders' conduct while visiting the
Special Commitment Center (SCC) on McNeil Island. The Commission
conducted an independent investigation of the allegations, determined
that sufficient evidence existed to support the complaint, and sent a
Statement of Allegations to Justice Sanders on October 8, 2003. In April
2004, the Commission determined that probable cause existed to believe
that Justice Sanders violated Canons 1, 2(A) and 3(A)(4) of the Code of
Judicial Conduct. After a fact-finding hearing, the Commission issued
its decision holding that Justice Sanders violated Canons 1 and 2(A),
but did not violate Canon 3(A)(4). The Commission found that Justice
Sanders' conduct violated Canon 1 by failing to enforce high standards
of judicial conduct and also violated Canon 2(A) by failing to promote
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
The Commission imposed the sanction of admonishment. Under Discipline
Rules for Judges 3, Justice Sanders filed a notice of contest.

Justice Sanders embarked on a tour of the SCC despite warnings from his
colleagues on the Supreme Court about potential ex parte contact with
litigants. During the tour of this facility, Justice Sanders accepted
documents on two separate occasions from the inmates. Moreover, in
meetings with the residents, some of whom had cases pending before the
court, he directly asked them about the issue of volitional control.

At the time of the visit, the Supreme Court was in the process of
deciding *In re Detention of Thorell*. Drafts of both a majority opinion
and a dissent by Justice Sanders were circulating among the justices at
the Supreme Court. *Thorell* was a seminal case in which separate
actions by six petitioners were combined, including at least one of the
SCC residents with whom Justice Sanders met. A pivotal issue before the
Supreme Court in *Thorell* was volitional control. The court was
weighing whether the “fact finder must determine that the person facing
commitment as a sexually violent predator (SVP) has serious difficulty
controlling behavior and, if so, whether this determination must be a
separate finding based upon a jury instruction.” Thus, the factual
record was before the court in each of the consolidated six cases.

The Commission held, and we agree, that the record established through
clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that Justice Sanders violated
Canons 1 and 2(A). In support of that holding, the findings reference
two of the three letters from resident Andre Brigham Young inviting the
justices to visit McNeil Island. Those letters indicate that the
residents were looking for something more than just a tour of the
facility. In fact, Young suggested that others (opposing counsel and
defense attorneys) should be asked to attend to avoid “the appearance of
partiality.” The letters in and of themselves should have given
sufficient notice to Justice Sanders that this visit had the potential
of being more than an institutional tour. Additional warning flags were
also raised by three justices who expressed concerns about the visit and
potential problems. Moreover, a simple computer check would have
revealed that Rickey Calhoun and Andre Brigham Young, two people
mentioned in the prior communication with Justice Sanders, had cases
pending before the Supreme Court. When Justice Sanders met with the
residents in small groups, he warned the residents that he could not
hear their particular case issues. However, these warnings were followed
by specific questions asking the residents about their confinement and
what they thought of volitional control.

The Commission justifiably found that Justice Sanders, with full
awareness of the potential for situations that could conflict with the
Code of Judicial Conduct, embarked on the tour and met with litigants
who had pending cases before the court. Further, by raising such
critical issues as volitional control with these litigants, Justice
Sanders created a situation that clearly violated both the letter and
the spirit of the canons and created serious concern for both counsel
and fellow jurists about the appearance of partiality.

Justice Sanders claims that a violation of Canons 1 and 2(A) cannot be
found without a concomitant violation of a proscribed act or canon and
thus the Commission's failure to find a direct violation of Canon
3(A)(4) precludes it from finding a violation of the other canons. We
disagree.

In our view, *Turco* is dispositive. There, the court found that the
judge's act of striking his wife in public had a sufficient nexus to the
judicial role, particularly when the judge heard domestic violence
cases. If extrajudicial tortious conduct can provide a nexus to the
judicial role, then a fortiori, judicial conduct can provide a basis for
a violation of Canons 1 and 2(A). In the instant case, Justice Sanders’
actions were not simply undertaken as a private citizen, but rather
within the context of his judicial duties. Our conclusion is underscored
by the decision in *In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Ritchie*. In
that case, Judge John G. Ritchie argued that Canons 1 and 2(A) of the
Code of Judicial Conduct, together with the statute regulating the
behavior, were too vague to give him adequate notice of the prohibited
behavior. In denying the claim, the court stated:

> It is true the conduct pursuant to which he was disciplined is not
> clearly proscribed by RCW 3.58.040, insofar as the statute does not
> expressly prohibit judges from combining business and pleasure trips,
> and does not define “reasonable traveling expenses” or “business of
> the court”.
>
> Judge Ritchie's vagueness challenge is ultimately immaterial, however,
> because he was not disciplined for violating the statute. Rather, he
> was censured for violating Canons 1 and 2(A) of the Code of Judicial
> Conduct which hold judges to a higher standard of integrity and
> require avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.

As noted in the Commission's decision, there are a number of facts in
this case that, when taken together, clearly demonstrate that a
predictable appearance of partiality could be foreseen.

Where a judge’s decisions are tainted by even a mere suspicion of
partiality, the effect on the public's confidence can be debilitating.
The canons of judicial conduct should be viewed in broad fashion, and
judges should err on the side of caution. Under Canon 3(D)(1), “judges
should disqualify themselves in a proceeding in which their impartiality
might reasonably be questioned.” In *Sherman*, the court found that
where a trial judge “may have inadvertently obtained information
critical to a central issue on remand, a reasonable person might
question his impartiality.” The court set the test for determining
impartiality:

> In deciding recusal matters, actual prejudice is not the standard. The
> Commission recognizes that where a trial judge's decisions are tainted
> by even a mere suspicion of partiality, the effect on the public's
> confidence in our judicial system can be debilitating. The test for
> determining whether the judge's impartiality might reasonably be
> questioned is an objective test that assumes that “a reasonable person
> knows and understands all the facts.”

This court in *In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Sanders* noted that
the interest of the State in maintaining and enforcing high standards of
judicial conduct under the auspices of Canon 1 is a compelling one. In
*Sanders*, this court balanced that interest against Justice Sanders'
First Amendment rights and found that an independent basis for finding a
violation of Canon 1 under those circumstances was not possible. Justice
Sanders argues that the language in Canon 1 is hortatory and therefore
cannot stand as an independent basis for a violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct. In the instant case, Canon 1 sets the conceptual
framework under which Canon 2(A) operates. Canon 2(A) provides the more
specific restraint, to wit: “Judges should act at all times in a manner
that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary.” Under the circumstances of this case, Canon 1 taken in
conjunction with Canon 2(A) provides a sufficiently specific basis to
find a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Here, it was clear
that there was a substantial basis and expectation that Justice Sanders
would be in contact with possible litigants who had pending litigation
before the court and that this contact would be viewed as improper. We
concur with the Commission's finding that it was clearly reasonable to
question the impartiality of the justice under the circumstances of this
case.
