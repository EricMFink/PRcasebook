# 2.1: Creating an Attorney-Client Relationship

## Clients & "Quasi-Clients"

Ideally, the formation of an attorney-client relationship involves formalities like an engagement letter, a retainer agreement, and the payment of attorney's fees. But none of those formalities are necessary. An attorney-client relationship may be formed whenever a person asks an attorney for legal advice and the attorney provides it, so long as a reasonable person could believe that an attorney-client relationship existed.

I will refer to people an attorney intends to represent as "clients," and people an attorney does not intend to represent as "quasi-clients." An attorney has an "express attorney-client relationship" with clients and an "implied attorney-client relationship" with quasi-clients. But express and implied attorney-client relationships impose many of the same duties on an attorney.

<div class="statute">

# Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 14 (2000)


A relationship of client and lawyer arises when:

(1) a person manifests to a lawyer the person's intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and either

> (a) the lawyer manifests to the person consent to do so; or

> (b) the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services; or

(2) a tribunal with power to do so appoints the lawyer to provide the services.

</div>


## The Duties of an Attorney

Attorneys owe certain legal duties to their clients and quasi-clients, whether they have an express attorney-client relationship or an implied attorney-client relationship. Those duties are reflected in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.

### Duty of Care: 

Attorneys have a duty to act with due diligence in pursuit of their client's interests. Model Rule 1.1.

### Duty of Loyalty: 

Attorneys may not represent any party with an interest adverse to any of their clients, and must refrain from self-dealing. Model Rules 1.7 & 1.8.

### Duty of Impartiality: 

Attorneys must provide their clients with all of the information their clients need in order to make informed decisions. Model Rule 1.4. Attorneys must also "exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice." Model Rule 2.1.

### Duty of Confidentiality: 

Attorneys must maintain in confidence all information obtained while representing their clients, and may not use any confidential client information in a way that could harm that client. Model Rule 1.6.

# Togstad v. Vesely, Otto, Miller & Keefe

## 291 N.W.2d 686 (Minn. 1980)

<div class="case=summary">

_Summary:_ John Togstad was paralyzed after surgery. His wife Joan Togstad met with attorney Jere Miller and asked him whether they had a viable medical malpractice action. Miller stated that he did not think his firm was interested, but he would consult with his partners. He did not charge Togstad or agree to represent her. He also did not inform her that he lacked experience in the area, encourage her to consult with another attorney, or warn her about the statute of limitations on medical malpractice actions.

After the statute of limitations expired, the Togstads filed a legal malpractice action. The jury found that an attorney-client relationship existed and that Miller was negligent, and awarded damages to the Togstads. The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed, holding that an attorney-client relationship existed because Miller provided legal advice and his advice was negligent.

</div>

This is an appeal by the defendants from a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court involving an action for legal malpractice. The jury found that the defendant attorney Jerre Miller was negligent and that, as a direct result of such negligence, plaintiff John Togstad sustained damages in the amount of $610,500 and his wife, plaintiff Joan Togstad, in the amount of $39,000. Defendants (Miller and his law firm) appeal to this court from the denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial. We affirm.

In August 1971, John Togstad began to experience severe headaches and on August 16, 1971, was admitted to Methodist Hospital where tests disclosed that the headaches were caused by a large aneurysm on the left internal carotid artery. The attending physician, Dr. Paul Blake, a neurological surgeon, treated the problem by applying a Selverstone clamp to the left common carotid artery. The clamp was surgically implanted on August 27, 1971, in Togstad's neck to allow the gradual closure of the artery over a period of days.

The treatment was designed to eventually cut off the blood supply through the artery and thus relieve the pressure on the aneurism, allowing the aneurism to heal. It was anticipated that other arteries, as well as the brain's collateral or cross-arterial system would supply the required blood to the portion of the brain which would ordinarily have been provided by the left carotid artery. The greatest risk associated with this procedure is that the patient may become paralyzed if the brain does not receive an adequate flow of blood. In the event the supply of blood becomes so low as to endanger the health of the patient, the adjustable clamp can be opened to establish the proper blood circulation.

In the early morning hours of August 29, 1971, a nurse observed that Togstad was unable to speak or move. At the time, the clamp was one-half (50%) closed. Upon discovering Togstad's condition, the nurse called a resident physician, who did not adjust the clamp. Dr. Blake was also immediately informed of Togstad's condition and arrived about an hour later, at which time he opened the clamp. Togstad is now severely paralyzed in his right arm and leg, and is unable to speak.

Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Ward Woods, testified that Togstad's paralysis and loss of speech was due to a lack of blood supply to his brain. Dr. Woods stated that the inadequate blood flow resulted from the clamp being 50% closed and that the negligence of Dr. Blake and the hospital precluded the clamp's being opened in time to avoid permanent brain damage. Specifically, Dr. Woods claimed that Dr. Blake and the hospital were negligent for (1) failing to place the patient in the intensive care unit or to have a special nurse conduct certain neurological tests every half-hour; (2) failing to write adequate orders; (3) failing to open the clamp immediately upon discovering that the patient was unable to speak; and (4) the absence of personnel capable of opening the clamp.

Dr. Blake and defendants' expert witness, Dr. Shelly Chou, testified that Togstad's condition was caused by blood clots going up the carotid artery to the brain. They both alleged that the blood clots were not a result of the Selverstone clamp procedure. In addition, they stated that the clamp must be about 90% closed before there will be a slowing of the blood supply through the carotid artery to the brain. Thus, according to Drs. Blake and Chou, when the clamp is 50% closed there is no effect on the blood flow to the brain.

About 14 months after her husband's hospitalization began, plaintiff Joan Togstad met with attorney Jerre Miller regarding her husband's condition. Neither she nor her husband was personally acquainted with Miller or his law firm prior to that time. John Togstad's former work supervisor, Ted Bucholz, made the appointment and accompanied Mrs. Togstad to Miller's office. Bucholz was present when Mrs. Togstad and Miller discussed the case.

Mrs. Togstad had become suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her husband's tragic condition due to the conduct and statements of the hospital nurses shortly after the paralysis occurred. One nurse told Mrs. Togstad that she had checked Mr. Togstad at 2 a. m. and he was fine; that when she returned at 3 a. m., by mistake, to give him someone else's medication, he was unable to move or speak; and that if she hadn't accidentally entered the room no one would have discovered his condition until morning. Mrs. Togstad also noticed that the other nurses were upset and crying, and that Mr. Togstad's condition was a topic of conversation.

Mrs. Togstad testified that she told Miller "everything that happened at the hospital," including the nurses' statements and conduct which had raised a question in her mind. She stated that she "believed" she had told Miller "about the procedure and what was undertaken, what was done, and what happened." She brought no records with her. Miller took notes and asked questions during the meeting, which lasted 45 minutes to an hour. At its conclusion, according to Mrs. Togstad, Miller said that "he did not think we had a legal case, however, he was going to discuss this with his partner." She understood that if Miller changed his mind after talking to his partner, he would call her. Mrs. Togstad "gave it" a few days and, since she did not hear from Miller, decided "that they had come to the conclusion that there wasn't a case." No fee arrangements were discussed, no medical authorizations were requested, nor was Mrs.

Togstad billed for the interview.

Mrs. Togstad denied that Miller had told her his firm did not have expertise in the medical malpractice field, urged her to see another attorney, or related to her that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions was two years. She did not consult another attorney until one year after she talked to Miller. Mrs. Togstad indicated that she did not confer with another attorney earlier because of her reliance on Miller's "legal advice" that they "did not have a case."

On cross-examination, Mrs. Togstad was asked whether she went to Miller's office "to see if he would take the case of her husband." She replied, "Well, I guess it was to go for legal advice, what to do, where shall we go from here? That is what we went for." Again in response to defense counsel's questions, Mrs. Togstad testified as follows:

> Q And it was clear to you, was it not, that what was taking place was a preliminary discussion between a prospective client and lawyer as to whether or not they wanted to enter into an attorney-client relationship?
> 
> A I am not sure how to answer that. It was for legal advice as to what to do.
> 
> Q And Mr. Miller was discussing with you your problem and indicating whether he, as a lawyer, wished to take the case, isn't that true?
> 
> A Yes.

On re-direct examination, Mrs. Togstad acknowledged that when she left Miller's office she understood that she had been given a "qualified, quality legal opinion that she and her husband did not have a malpractice case."

Miller's testimony was different in some respects from that of Mrs. Togstad. Like Mrs. Togstad, Miller testified that Mr. Bucholz arranged and was present at the meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes. According to Miller, Mrs. Togstad described the hospital incident, including the conduct of the nurses. He asked her questions, to which she responded. Miller testified that "the only thing I told her after we had pretty much finished the conversation was that there was nothing related in her factual circumstances that told me that she had a case that our firm would be interested in undertaking."

Miller also claimed he related to Mrs. Togstad "that because of the grievous nature of the injuries sustained by her husband, that this was only my opinion and she was encouraged to ask another attorney if she wished for another opinion" and "she ought to do so promptly." He testified that he informed Mrs. Togstad that his firm "was not engaged as experts" in the area of medical malpractice, and that they associated with the Charles Hvass firm in cases of that nature. Miller stated that at the end of the conference he told Mrs. Togstad that he would consult with Charles Hvass and if Hvass's opinion differed from his, Miller would so inform her. Miller recollected that he called Hvass a "couple days" later and discussed the case with him. It was Miller's impression that Hvass thought there was no liability for malpractice in the case. Consequently, Miller did not communicate with Mrs. Togstad further.

On cross-examination, Miller testified as follows:

> Q Now, so there is no misunderstanding, and I am reading from your deposition, you understood that she was consulting with you as a lawyer, isn't that correct?
> 
> A That's correct.
> 
> Q That she was seeking legal advice from a professional attorney licensed to practice in this state and in this community?
> 
A I think you and I did have another interpretation or use of the term "Advice." She was there to see whether or not she had a case and whether the firm would accept it.
> 
> Q We have two aspects; number one, your legal opinion concerning liability of a case for malpractice; number two, whether there was or wasn't liability, whether you would accept it, your firm, two separate elements, right?
> 
> A I would say so.
> 
> Q Were you asked on page 6 in the deposition, folio 14, "And you understood that she was seeking legal advice at the time that she was in your office, that is correct also, isn't it?" And did you give this answer, "I don't want to engage in semantics with you, but my impression was that she and Mr. Bucholz were asking my opinion after having related the incident that I referred to." The next question, "Your legal opinion?" Your answer, "Yes." Were those questions asked and were they given?
> 
> MR. COLLINS: Objection to this, Your Honor. It is not impeachment.
> 
THE COURT: Overruled.
> 
> THE WITNESS: Yes, I gave those answers. Certainly, she was seeking my opinion as an attorney in the sense of whether or not there was a case that the firm would be interested in undertaking.

Kenneth Green, a Minneapolis attorney, was called as an expert by plaintiffs. He stated that in rendering legal advice regarding a claim of medical malpractice, the "minimum" an attorney should do would be to request medical authorizations from the client, review the hospital records, and consult with an expert in the field. John McNulty, a Minneapolis attorney, and Charles Hvass testified as experts on behalf of the defendants. McNulty stated that when an attorney is consulted as to whether he will take a case, the lawyer's only responsibility in refusing it is to so inform the party. He testified, however, that when a lawyer is asked his legal opinion on the merits of a medical malpractice claim, community standards require that the attorney check hospital records and consult with an expert before rendering his opinion. 

Hvass stated that he had no recollection of Miller's calling him in October 1972 relative to the Togstad matter. He testified that:

> A When a person comes in to me about a medical malpractice action, based upon what the individual has told me, I have to make a decision as to whether or not there probably is or probably is not, based upon that information, medical malpractice. And if, in my judgment, based upon what the client has told me, there is not medical malpractice, I will so inform the client.

Hvass stated, however, that he would never render a "categorical" opinion. In addition, Hvass acknowledged that if he were consulted for a "legal opinion" regarding medical malpractice and 14 months had expired since the incident in question, "ordinary care and diligence" would require him to inform the party of the two-year statute of limitations applicable to that type of action.

This case was submitted to the jury by way of a special verdict form. The jury found that Dr. Blake and the hospital were negligent and that Dr. Blake's negligence (but not the hospital's) was a direct cause of the injuries sustained by John Togstad; that there was an attorney-client contractual relationship between Mrs. Togstad and Miller; that Miller was negligent in rendering advice regarding the possible claims of Mr. and Mrs. Togstad; that, but for Miller's negligence, plaintiffs would have been successful in the prosecution of a legal action against Dr. Blake; and that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Togstad was negligent in pursuing their claims against Dr. Blake. The jury awarded damages to Mr. Togstad of $610,500 and to Mrs. Togstad of $39,000.

In a legal malpractice action of the type involved here, four elements must be shown: (1) that an attorney-client relationship existed; (2) that defendant acted negligently or in breach of contract; (3) that such acts were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' damages; (4) that but for defendant's conduct the plaintiffs would have been successful in the prosecution of their medical malpractice claim.

We believe it is unnecessary to decide whether a tort or contract theory is preferable for resolving the attorney-client relationship question raised by this appeal. The tort and contract analyses are very similar in a case such as the instant one, and we conclude that under either theory the evidence shows that a lawyer-client relationship is present here. The thrust of Mrs. Togstad's testimony is that she went to Miller for legal advice, was told there wasn't a case, and relied upon this advice in failing to pursue the claim for medical malpractice. In addition, according to Mrs. Togstad, Miller did not qualify his legal opinion by urging her to seek advice from another attorney, nor did Miller inform her that he lacked expertise in the medical malpractice area. Assuming this testimony is true, we believe a jury could properly find that Mrs. Togstad sought and received legal advice from Miller under circumstances which made it reasonably foreseeable to Miller that Mrs. Togstad would be injured if the advice were negligently given. Thus, under either a tort or contract analysis, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the existence of an attorney-client relationship. 

Defendants argue that even if an attorney-client relationship was established the evidence fails to show that Miller acted negligently in assessing the merits of the Togstads' case. They appear to contend that, at most, Miller was guilty of an error in judgment which does not give rise to legal malpractice. However, this case does not involve a mere error of judgment. The gist of plaintiffs' claim is that Miller failed to perform the minimal research that an ordinarily prudent attorney would do before rendering legal advice in a case of this nature.

There is also sufficient evidence in the record establishing that, but for Miller's negligence, plaintiffs would have been successful in prosecuting their medical malpractice claim. Dr. Woods, in no uncertain terms, concluded that Mr. Togstad's injuries were caused by the medical malpractice of Dr. Blake. Defendants' expert testimony to the contrary was obviously not believed by the jury. Thus, the jury reasonably found that had plaintiff's medical malpractice action been properly brought, plaintiffs would have recovered.

Based on the foregoing, we hold that the jury's findings are adequately supported by the record. Accordingly we uphold the trial court's denial of defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury verdict.

## Representation of an Organization

When an attorney represents an entity, the attorney's client is the entity, not the entity's agents. In other words, when an attorney represents a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or unincorporated association, the attorney's client is the organization, not the employees of the organization. Or to put it another way, the attorney has an attorney-client relationship with the organization, but does not necessarily have an attorney-client relationship with the employees of the organization. Specifically, the attorney has a duty to represent the organization, even when its interests diverge from the interests of its employees.

However, an attorney representing an organization must ensure that the employees of the organization understand that the attorney only represents the organization, and not its employees. In other words, the employees must understand that the organization's attorney is not their attorney, and that the organization's attorney has professional duties only to the organization. This can be difficult to explain, especially when employees identify their interests with those of the organization. But attorneys for organizations must clarify their legal relationship to the employees of those organizations, in order to avoid creating an attorney-client relationship.

<div class="statute">

# Model Rule 1.13: Organization as Client


a. A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.

b. If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization, or a violation of law that reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and that is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. Unless the lawyer reasonably believes that it is not necessary in the best interest of the organization to do so, the lawyer shall refer the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the circumstances to the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.

c. Except as provided in paragraph (d), if

	1. despite the lawyer's efforts in accordance with paragraph (b) the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon or fails to address in a timely and appropriate manner an action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law, and
 
	2. the lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation whether or not Rule 1.6 permits such disclosure, but only if and to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial injury to the organization.

d. Paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to information relating to a lawyer's representation of an organization to investigate an alleged violation of law, or to defend the organization or an officer, employee or other constituent associated with the organization against a claim arising out of an alleged violation of law.

e. A lawyer who reasonably believes that he or she has been discharged because of the lawyer's actions taken pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c), or who withdraws under circumstances that require or permit the lawyer to take action under either of those paragraphs, shall proceed as the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to assure that the organization's highest authority is informed of the lawyer's discharge or withdrawal.

f. In dealing with an organization's directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the organization's interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.

g. A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, subject to the provisions of Rule 1.7. If the organization's consent to the dual representation is required by Rule 1.7, 

the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders.

# Ferranti Intern. PLC v. Clark

## 767 F. Supp. 670 (E.D. Pa. 1991)

<div class="case summary">

Summary: William Clark was general counsel of Ferranti and hired Hogan & Hartson to represent the company in relation to a federal investigation. Hogan & Hartson informed Ferranti's employees that they should consider retaining an attorney. During the investigation, Clark provided confidential information to Hogan & Hartson. Eventually, Ferranti filed an action against Clark for breach of fiduciary duty and legal malpractice. Clark objected to Hogan & Hartson's representation of Ferranti. The court dismissed Clark's objections, on the ground that he knew Hogan & Hartson never represented him personally.

</div>

LUDWIG, District Judge.

Plaintiff sues for breach of fiduciary duty and professional malpractice and to rescind a $2.75 million employee "settlement and release" agreement, which the complaint alleges was obtained by extortion. Defendant William A. Clark's motion to disqualify the firm of Hogan & Hartson from representing plaintiff Ferranti International PLC in this action will be denied for the following reasons:

An attorney-client relationship, express or implied, did not exist between Hogan & Hartson and William A. Clark when he was Ferranti International, Inc.'s vice president and general counsel.

In July, 1986 defendant Clark, himself an attorney, retained Hogan & Hartson to represent plaintiff Ferranti International pic and its subsidiaries in regard to a government investigation of alleged wrongdoing on the part of their employees. He did so in his capacity as Ferranti International, Inc.'s vice president and general counsel. The need for representation was triggered by a federal grand jury subpoena served on plaintiff's subsidiary, the Marquardt Company. Thereafter, the investigation was widened with target letters and follow-up subpoenas to corporate employees of plaintiff and plaintiff's other subsidiaries.

Hogan & Hartson did not represent the corporations' employees. Hogan & Hartson attorneys repeatedly stated to the corporations' employees in defendant's presence that they should obtain separate counsel because of the potential conflict of interest between employer and employee. Defendant helped arrange for employees to be separately represented.

Any perception by defendant that he became a client or was a prospective client of Hogan & Hartson as to his personal legal matters was unreasonable and without foundation. Defendant's position as general counsel and corporate officer excluded this law firm from acting as his personal attorney because of the self-evident interest conflict. Given the circumstances, the personal matters discussed did not involve an attorney-client relationship. 

The information given Hogan & Hartson by defendant regarding plaintiff, its subsidiaries and employees was communicated by him in his capacity as Ferranti International, Inc.'s vice president and general counsel. Proof of defendant's knowledge of such information does not appear to require that a Hogan & Hartson attorney testify as a witness.

Until shortly before the present disqualification motion was filed, February 28, 1991, defendant's sole objection to Hogan & Hartson's representation of plaintiff in this action involved the possible calling of Hogan & Hartson attorneys as plaintiff's witnesses. That was first noted by defendant's counsel as a potential problem in September, 1990. If either party intends to call a Hogan & Hartson attorney as a witness, the court should be notified at least 60 days in advance of trial, and any issue thereby raised can be considered at that time.

Defendant's status as an attorney has contradictory facets. He selected Hogan & Hartson to be plaintiff's counsel and subsequently worked with several of its attorneys in a confidential and apparently close relationship on behalf of plaintiff, the parent of his then employer. Having done so and formed such associations, he may understandably resent and find objectionable the turn of events in which he is now being sued not only by the same law firm but also on behalf of the client that he brought to that firm. However, these personal and business considerations do not necessitate disqualification on legal-ethical grounds.

This is not a case in which a layperson might have perceived or reasonably misperceived that his corporate employer's attorney was also representing him. As a general counsel, defendant must have keenly appreciated the distinction between the corporation and its employees as well as the employees' need for separate counsel. Defendant's assertion that the personal comments and observations exchanged between him and Hogan & Hartson attorneys were in contemplation of, or resulted in, a personal attorney-client relationship is factitious and unconvincing.

Although it became a Hogan & Hartson client through defendant, plaintiff has a cognizable interest in being permitted to continue to be represented by this firm. Moreover, disqualificationโwhich is an increasingly frequent issue in the courtsโ may be the subject of tactical abuse. A party's choice of counsel should be set aside only where the circumstances legally require doing so.

Under the Rules of Professional Conduct and the cases, there is no legal basis on which to disqualify Hogan & Hartson. An evidentiary hearing is unnecessary.

</div> 

##### Questions:

1. Why did Clark object to Hogan & Hartson representing Ferranti in its action action against him? Why did the court dismiss Clark's objections?

2. Clark was an attorney and general counsel for Ferranti. Would the court have reached the same conclusion if Clark were not an attorney? 

3. Should Ferranti be able to use confidential information provided to Hogan & Hartson by Clark?

4. What should Clark have done differently?

--- 

## Prospective Clients

People and organizations do not always choose to form an attorney-client relationship immediately. Sometimes, they consider forming an attorney-client relationship with multiple attorneys or firms before choosing one.

A "prospective client" is a person or organization that discusses the possibility of forming an attorney-client relationship with an attorney or firm. If an attorney or firm learns confidential information from a prospective client, the attorney or firm may be precluded from representing other parties in the same matter, if their interests are adverse to those of the prospective client.

Accordingly, attorneys should try to prevent prospective clients from disclosing confidential information, in order to avoid disqualification from representing adverse parties. And attorneys must determine whether potential clients have disclosed any confidential information, because it creates a duty of confidentiality.

# 2.2: Ending an Attorney-Client Relationship

It is surprisingly easy to create an attorney-client relationship, and it can be surprisingly hard for an attorney to end one. In general, a client can end an attorney-client relationship at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. But attorneys cannot end an attorney-client relationship without good reason. Sometimes, attorneys must end an attorney-client relationship, and other times the rules of professional conduct prevent attorneys from ending an attorney-client relationship. In any case, attorneys may have duties to their clients that survive the attorneyclient relationship, especially the duty of confidentiality.

Sometimes, an attorney must end an attorney-client relationship. For example, an attorney cannot represent a client if the client fires the attorney, the attorney cannot effectively represent the client, the attorney has a conflict of interest, or representation would violate the rules of professional conduct.

Under certain circumstances, attorneys may choose to end an attorney-client relationship. But the ability of an attorney to end an attorney-client relationship is limited by the rules of professional conduct. Attorneys can end an attorney-client relationship only if they are permitted or required to end the relationship by the rules of professional conduct. They may be subject to discipline for ending an attorney-client relationship, even if it is permitted or required by the rules of professional conduct. And they may have duties to former clients that survive the attorneyclient relationship.

Before ending an attorney-client relationship, an attorney should determine whether good cause exists to end the relationship. If an attorney ends an attorney-client relationship without good cause, the attorney may be subject to discipline and liable to the client for malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty.

### Model Rule 1.16: Declining or Terminating Representation



### Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 31 (2000): Termination of a Lawyer's Authority




### Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 32 (2000): Discharge by a Client and Withdrawal by a Lawyer


## Discharge by the Client 

Typically, clients can end the attorney-client relationship simply by firing their attorney. Under Model Rule 1.16(a)(3), "a lawyer shall not represent a client or โฆ shall withdraw from the representation of a client if โฆ the lawyer is discharged." And as Section 32(1) of the Restatement observes, "a client may discharge a lawyer at any time."

However, a client's ability to fire an attorney and end the attorney-client relationship is not absolute. Under some circumstances, a court may prohibit a client from firing an attorney, and order the attorney to continue representing the client. For example, a client typically cannot fire an attorney immediately before trial, because it could enable clients to improperly delay the proceedings.

Criminal defendants have a limited right to fire appointed counsel and receive alternative counsel. Criminal defendants also have a limited right to fire appointed counsel and represent themselves. Among other things, criminal defendant must express an "unequivocal" desire to represent themselves. In theory, this means that criminal defendants cannot fire appointed counsel only because they believe appointed counsel is bad.

When a client fires an attorney and hires a new attorney, the former attorney may have a claim against the former client. In a civil claim, the former attorney may recover the value of the services rendered.

## Demov, Morris, Levine & Shein v. Glantz, 53 N.Y.2d 553 (N.Y. 1981)




##### Questions

1. If a client fires an attorney for actual or perceived incompetence, should the attorney be able to recover in quantum meruit?

2. Many courts have held that a fired attorney may also recover a percentage of a contingent fee. "The outgoing attorney may elect to take compensation on the basis of a presently fixed dollar amount based upon quantum meruit for the reasonable value of services or, in lieu thereof, the outgoing attorney has the right to elect a contingent percentage fee based on the proportionate share of the work performed on the whole case." Lai Ling Cheng v. Modansky, 73 N.Y.2d 454 (1989). Do you agree with this conclusion?

## Withdrawal by the Attorney 

### Permissive Withdrawal

While it is easy for clients to end an attorney-client relationship, it can be harder for attorneys. Model Rule 1.16(b) identifies several circumstances under which an attorney may end an attorney-client relationship.

Of course, attorneys can end attorney-client relationships at will, when it will not harm their clients. Model Rule 1.16(b)(1). But this exception is largely irrelevant, because clients typically abhor reluctant attorneys, and clients who suffer no harm rarely file malpractice actions. Clients who can afford another attorney say good riddance, and clients who cannot are harmed.

Attorneys can also end an attorney-client relationship if their client misbehaves. For example, attorneys can end an attorney-client relationship if their client uses their legal advice to break the law. Attorneys can also end an attorney-client relationship based on irreconcilable differences of opinion. And attorneys can end an attorney-client relationship if their client cannot or will not pay for representation, or for any other "good reason." Model Rule 1.16(b)(2-7).

However, attorneys cannot simply end an attorney-client relationship and walk away. They must seek permission from the court, and cannot end an attorney-client relationship without the court's approval. If the court orders an attorney to continue representing a client, the attorney must comply, even if the attorney has good cause to withdraw. Model Rule 1.16(c). Typically, courts permit attorneys to withdraw only if they show that their client has retained other counsel or refuses representation. If the court permits withdrawal, the attorney must make a reasonable effort to protect the client's interests. Among other things, the attorney must provide reasonable notice of withdrawal to the client, transfer documents and property to the client, and refund any unearned payments or fees. However, the attorney may retain documents relating to the client, to the extent permitted by law.

### Mandatory Withdrawal

Under certain circumstances, attorneys must end an attorney-client relationship. Model Rule 1.16(a) provides that attorneys must withdraw if continued representation would cause a violation of the rules of professional conduct or some other law, their physical or mental condition materially impairs their ability to represent the client, or the client terminates representation.

Obviously, attorneys cannot represent clients seeking legal advice in furtherance of a criminal enterprise. For example, attorneys cannot provide legal advice that enables a client to commit or perpetuate fraud. However, attorneys are not required to withdraw from representation simply because their client suggests an improper or illegal action. Model Rule 1.16, Comment 2. On the contrary, they should counsel their client against such action, and withdraw only if their client insists on proceeding.

Attorneys also cannot represent a client if it would create a conflict of interest. If an attorney has previously represented a client with interests adverse to those of a potential or current client, the attorney must decline or withdraw from representation, unless the client can and does provide informed consent to representation. In some cases, a conflict of interest may preclude informed consent.

Attorneys must also withdraw from representation if their physical or mental state will materially impair their ability to represent their client. Obviously, attorneys who incur serious physical or mental injuries may not be able to continue representing their clients. However, in some cases, they may be subject to discipline.


## Whiting v. Lacara, 187 F. 3d 317 (2d Cir. 1999)



##### Questions

1. Why did Lacara claim permissive withdrawal, rather than mandatory withdrawal?

2. Why did the district court deny Lacara's motion to withdraw? Why did the circuit court reverse?

3. How serious is the risk of Rule 11 sanctions? Is there a real conflict of interest?

4. Will Whiting be able to retain new counsel? If not, will he have to proceed pro se?

## Effective Withdrawal

Sometimes an attorney-client relationship doesn't really end, but just fades away. Often, an attorney represents a client in a matter and the client has no need for further representation. For example, an attorney may represent a client in relation to a particular transaction or dispute, like the purchase of a home or an automobile accident. Ideally, the attorney and client will have formed an agreement, specifying the scope of representation, in which case the attorney-client relationship typically ends when the matter is concluded. But occasionally they may not, by accident or design. In that case, the attorney-client relationship still typically ends when the matter is concluded, although it may be less certain. Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 31(2)(e) (2000).

In other cases, an attorney may have a long-term relationship with a client that gradually peters out over time. In that case, it may be hard to know whether and when the attorney-client relationship has ended. Worse, the attorney and client may disagree. An attorney may believe the relationship continues, only to be surprised when the client returns bills unpaid. And a client may believe the relationship continues, only to be surprised when the attorney ignores the client's affairs.

Generally, an attorney-client relationship continues to exist so long as a reasonable client would believe that it continues to exist. If an attorney wants to end an attorney-client relationship, the attorney should explicitly inform the client in writing that it has ended, and return any documents or property that belongs to the client. But attorneys are often reluctant to end long-term attorneyclient relationships, in the hope that the client will eventually return and provide more business.

In that case, courts will ask whether a reasonable client would believe that an attorney-client relationship continued to exist under the circumstances.

## Duties After Withdrawal

Under Model Rule 1.16(d), an attorney who withdraws from representing a client has a duty to minimize any potential harm to the client. Among other things, the attorney must provide reasonable notice of withdrawal, return any documents or other property that belongs to the client, and refund any unearned fees or payments. However, some attorney work product may belong to the attorney, and some states permit attorneys to retain the client's property until the client pays any outstanding fees.

However, the attorney also has a permanent duty of confidentiality to former clients.

# 2.3: Attorney & Client as Agent & Principal 

The attorney-client relationship is a principal-agent relationship. The client is the principal and the attorney is the client's agent. But it is a unique form of principal-agent relationship, because the client's ability to control the attorney's exercise of agency is limited, and because the attorney has duties not only to the client, but also to the court and the public.

In this respect, the attorney-client relationship resembles other professional relations. In the doctor-patient relationship, patients decide whether to seek treatment, but doctors decide how to provide treatment. In the professor-student relationship, students decide whether to attend school, but professors decide what to teach. And in the priest-penitent relationship, priests have duties not only to the penitent, but also to God.

In an attorney-client relationship, the client decides the objectives, but the attorney decides the means. The client decides how much authority to delegate to the attorney, and retains the right to make all major decisions, but cannot dictate all of the attorney's actions. The attorney is entitled and required to exercise independent judgment about how to achieve the client's goals.

For example, in a contract negotiation, the client is entitled to decide the key terms, but the attorney must decide how to achieve them. In civil litigation, the client is entitled to decide whether to settle, but the attorney must decide whether to assert a particular claim or defense. And in criminal litigation, the client is entitled to decide whether to plead guilty, but the attorney must decide which witnesses to call and how to conduct cross-examination.

Moreover, in an attorney-client relationship, the attorney not only has a duty to protect the interests of the client, but also has a duty to protect the interests of the court and the public. An attorney is an agent of both the client and the court. In theory, while attorneys must pursue the interests of their clients, they also must not mislead the court, or allow their clients to lie to the court. Of course, in practice, this is often easier said than done.

## Attorneys as Agents

As agents of their clients, attorneys often have the authority to act on behalf of their clients, but it may take the form of express, implied, or apparent authority.

- Express Authority

When an attorney acts pursuant to authority explicitly granted by the client. For example, clients can grant express authority to an attorney in an engagement letter or later instructions.

- Implied Authority: 

When an attorney acts pursuant to authority necessarily granted by the attorney-client relationship. For example, attorneys have implied authority to exercise discretion in implementing the instructions of their clients. 
 
- Apparent Authority

When an attorney acts pursuant to authority delegated by the client and an opposing party relies on the delegation, especially when the authority is normally reserved to the client. For example, if a client delegates the authority to approve a final settlement, and an opposing party relies on the delegation, the attorney may have apparent authority, even though the decision to approve a final settlement is normally reserved to the client.

When attorneys act pursuant to express, implied, or apparent authority, their actions bind their clients. But when attorneys act without authority, their actions are ultra vires, and may not be binding. Of course, when attorneys act without authority, they may also be liable for malpractice.

## Attorneys as Fiduciaries

The attorney-client relationship is unusual because attorneys are fiduciaries of their clients. A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal duty of trust with another party, or "principal." A fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care. As Cardozo famously explained, a fiduciary "is held to something stricter than the morals of the marketplace. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior." Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458 (1928). Accordingly, fiduciaries must act only for the sole benefit and interest of the principal, and must put the interests of the principal above their own interests.

As fiduciaries, attorneys have a legal duty to act only in the interests of their clients, and to put the interests of their clients above their own interests. Accordingly, attorneys may never form a relationship that would create a conflict of interest with a current or former client, without the client's informed consent.

# 2.4: Client as Principal

## Decisions Reserved to Clients

As the principal, the client has the sole authority to make certain important decisions about their legal representation. Model Rule 1.2(a) provides that an attorney must respect a client's decisions about the goals of representation and consult with the client about the means of achieving those goals. It also identifies particular decisions that are reserved to the client, specifically the decision whether to settle in a civil case, and the decisions how to plead, whether to waive jury trial, and whether to testify in a criminal case.

However, attorneys retain considerable discretion to make decisions about how to pursue representation, so long as those decisions are consistent with the client's decisions, and implicitly authorized by the client as necessary to representation. In other words, the client is entitled to specify the goals of representation, but not to control the attorney's every decision in pursuit of those goals.

## Bronson v. Borst, 404 A. 2d 960 (D.C. App. 1979)


## Clients With Diminished Capacity 

Attorneys often represent clients who have an impaired ability to make or express decisions. For example, attorneys often represent minors, who cannot make legally binding decisions. 

Attorneys may also represent people with physical impairments that affect their ability to express their decisions, or mental impairments that affect their ability to make decisions that are in their own best interests.

When an attorney represents a legally, physically, or mentally impaired client, the client remains the principal and is entitled to dignity and respect. Accordingly, the attorney must provide relevant information to the client, consult with the client, and pursue the client's wishes, whenever it is possible and in the client's best interests.

Sometimes, impaired clients have legal representatives empowered to make decisions on their behalf. In that case, the attorney must ordinarily obey the decisions of the legal representative. But the attorney must also inform the client about those decisions, and consult with the client whenever possible.

Regardless, the attorney must always put the client's interests first. If the attorney represents the impaired client directly, then the attorney has a fiduciary duty to the client, and must ensure that the legal representative's actions are in the client's best interests. If the attorney represents the legal representative, then the attorney has a fiduciary duty to the legal representative, but still must ensure that the legal representative respects its own fiduciary duty to the client. For example, if an attorney represents a client who is a minor, the attorney must obey the decisions of the client's guardian, but must also consult with the client, in order to determine the client's wishes, and ensure that the client's guardian does not violate its fiduciary duties. Likewise, if an attorney represents a comatose client, the attorney must obey the decisions of the client's guardian, but must also ensure that the guardian does not violate its fiduciary duties.

Sometimes, it is unclear whether a client is impaired. The client may be unable to communicate with the attorney, unable to make consistent decisions, unable to make good decisions, or unwilling to conform to social expectations. These are hard cases. If a direct attorney-client relationship is untenable, the attorney should seek the appointment of a legal representative.

But if the attorney can represent the client directly, then the attorney must act in the client's best interests. This can create a conflict, if the attorney believes that the client's instructions are inconsistent with the client's best interests. Should the attorney obey the client?

### Rule 1.14: Client with Diminished Capacity



### Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 24 (2000): A Client with Diminished Capacity




## People v. Bolden, 99 Cal. App. 3d 375 (Cal. Ct. App. 1979)



## 2.5: Ex Parte Communications

Model Rule 4.2 prohibits attorneys from engaging in "ex parte" communications, or communications with a represented person without the consent of that person's attorney or the permission of the court.

In theory, the purpose of the prohibition on ex parte communications with represented persons is to help protect clients and ensure they receive the advice of counsel. As Model Rule 4.2, Comment [1] explains:

> This Rule contributes to the proper functioning of the legal system by protecting a person who has chosen to be represented by a lawyer in a matter against possible overreaching by other lawyers who are participating in the matter, interference by those lawyers with the client-lawyer relationship and the uncounselled disclosure of information relating to the representation.

The prohibition on ex parte communications applies to all represented persons involved in a matter. Accordingly, it prohibits ex parte communications with not only represented persons who are adverse parties, but also represented persons who are co-parties or non-parties. And it applies to directed communications. In other words, an attorney cannot avoid the prohibition by instructing or advising a non-attorney to contact a represented person. Furthermore, the prohibition on ex parte communications is not waivable by the client, and it applies even if the client initiates the communication, requiring the attorney to immediately end the communication. Model Rule 4.2, Comment [2] & [3].

The prohibition on ex parte communications with represented persons may also apply to the employees of represented organizations. Most courts have held that attorneys cannot engage in ex parte communications with employees of a represented organization who control the organization, acted on behalf of the organization in the matter, or make legal decisions for the organization. In other words, upper management and people directly involved in the matter are off-limits, but other employees are not. In particular, former employees are generally fair game.

Notably, Model Rule 4.2 does incorporate a mens rea requirement. Attorneys cannot be disciplined for engaging in an ex parte communication with a represented person unless they knew or should have known that the person was represented in relation to the matter. Model Rule 4.2, Comment [8].

And Model Rule 4.2 does not prohibit all ex parte communications. Nothing prevents an attorney from engaging in ex parte communications with a represented person about subjects unrelated to the matter in which they are represented. And nothing prevents an attorney who is not representing anyone in relation to matter from engaging in ex parte communications with a represented party. In other words, attorneys may continue to pursue unrelated business, and clients may consult with outside counsel. Model Rule 4.2, Comment [4].

In addition, Model Rule 4.2 only applies to attorneys. Nothing prevents represented persons from engaging in ex parte communications with each other. And if represented persons choose to communicate with each other, their attorneys may provide them with advice. "Parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other, and a lawyer is not prohibited from advising a client concerning a communication that the client is legally entitled to make." Model Rule 4.2, Comment [4], Indeed, attorneys can probably even advise their clients to engage in ex parte communications with represented parties.

##### Questions

1. What is the purpose of Model Rule 4.2 and its prohibition on attorneys engaging in ex parte communications with represented persons? Is it intended to protect clients or their attorneys?

2. Why don't the model rules prohibit clients from engaging in ex parte communications? Should ex parte communications between represented persons be encouraged, discouraged, or neither?

3. Haley retained counsel when the action at issue went to trial. If he had engaged in ex parte communications with Highland while represented by an attorney, would it have violated Model Rule 4.2? Should attorneys who are parties to an action and represented by counsel be permitted to engage in ex parte communications with represented persons? What if both parties are attorneys represented by counsel?

# 2.6 Attorney's Fees

## Reasonable Fees 

Attorneys can only charge a reasonable fee for their services. But the reasonableness of an attorney's fee depends on the circumstances. Main Street lawyers and Wall Street lawyers can and do charge very different fees for their services. And contingent fees necessarily reflect the risk of failure.

In theory, state bar associations are supposed to ensure that attorneys charge reasonable fees. But in practice, they are reluctant to question attorney's fee agreements. In fact, contract law may protect clients from excessive fees more effectively than the rules of professional responsibility.

## In the Matter of Fordham, 423 Mass. 481 (Mass. 1996)



##### Questions:

1. Was the problem with Fordham's fee the rate he charged, the number of hours he billed, or both?

2. Why do other attorneys litigating similar cases bill so much less? Is it because cases of this kind should take less work or because their clients cannot spend any additional money?

3. What if Fordham's acquittal rate were substantially higher than other attorneys in the same practice area? Should he be able to charge a higher rate? How much higher?

4. What if Fordham estimated a fee of $50,000 in advance, and billed only for work actually completed?

## Contingent Fees 

Typically, attorneys charge an hourly fee for their services, often billed in some fraction of an hour. But some attorneys charge a fixed fee for their services. Historically, the most prestigious law firms charged a fixed fee for their services, often refusing to provide an itemized list of the services they had provided. Today, detailed billing is the norm, with the exception of attorneys providing retail representation in routine matters, and appointed counsel for indigent defendants.

However, in some circumstances, attorneys and their clients will form a contingent fee agreement, under which both parties agree that the attorney is entitled to a certain percentage of any recovery, often 33%. Contingent fee agreements are typically associated with personal injury actions, where the plaintiff often has a strong claim, but lacks the financial resources to pursue litigation. Under a contingent fee agreement, the attorney can fund the litigation, in exchange for a chance of a much larger recovery.

But contingent fee agreements can also make sense when a client wants to control an attorney's incentives. Under an hourly billing agreement, the attorney has an incentive to bill as many hours as possible, even as the additional work produces diminishing returns to the client. And under a fixed fee billing agreement, the attorney has an incentive to do as little work as possible. But under a contingent fee agreement, the attorney simply has an incentive to win.

Under Model Rule 1.5(c), contingency fee agreements cannot be unreasonable and must be in writing. In addition, contingent fees are prohibited in criminal law and family law actions. Attorneys cannot form a contingent fee agreement to be paid only if a criminal defendant is acquitted or receives some other favorable outcome. And attorneys typically cannot form a contingent fee agreement to receive compensation from the resolution of a domestic dispute.

##### Questions:

1. Why wasn't Culpepper entitled to compensation for the work he actually did for Cole?

2. Could the contingent fee agreement between Cole and Culpepper have included a clause requiring Cole to obtain Culpepper's consent before accepting or rejecting a settlement offer?


# 2.7: Financial Relationships with Clients

## Client Trust Accounts

When attorneys hold money or property in trust for their clients they must never commingle it with their own funds or property, on pain of sanction, typically suspension or disbarment. In other words, if a client deposits funds with an attorney, the attorney must place those funds in a trust account, and if a client deposits physical property, the attorney must also hold that property separately, typically in a safety deposit box. Commingling funds or property is a per se violation, with few exceptions, primarily in order to enable an attorney to pay any banking fees on a client's trust account.

State bar associations carefully monitor attorney trust accounts and punish any commingling of funds. Some state bar associations even randomly audit attorney trust accounts, looking for violations. State rules of professional conduct typically require attorneys to deposit client funds in an interest-bearing trust account. Many states require attorneys to deposit some or all of the interest generated by client trust accounts into a common fund. This Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts ("IOLTA") fund is used to provide legal services to indigent clients.

Attorneys may withdraw funds from a client's trust account in order to pay the client's attorney fees, as they are earned. The rule against commingling prohibits attorneys from using funds from a client trust account to pay business or personal expenses, and the attorney must return any funds remaining in a client's trust account to the client when the representation ends. When a client receives a settlement or award, the attorney must deposit the funds in the client's trust account, and then withdraw funds to pay the client's attorney fees and disburse to the client. Specifically, if the attorney and the client have a contingent fee agreement, the attorney must pay the client's contingent fee from the client trust account.

## Equity as Compensation

Sometimes, attorneys agree to accept an equity interest in their client's property, in lieu of attorney fees. For example, an attorney representing a corporation may accept shares of the company rather than cash. This kind of agreement can benefit both the client and the attorney, especially if the client is cash-poor, but is a promising investment. The client receives legal advice with no upfront expense, and the attorney receives an investment potentially worth much more than the hourly fees. Moreover, the attorney has an incentive to provide the best possible advice, because it will increase the value of their investment.

But equity compensation is not limited to securities. An attorney may agree to represent a client in exchange for an equity interest in the client's real estate. Or a patent attorney may agree to prosecute a patent in exchange for an interest in the patent.

In any case, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct permits equity compensation, but only if the attorney complies with the requirements of Model Rule 1.8(a). Essentially, the attorney must disclose the terms of the agreement to the client, the attorney must advise the client to seek independent legal counsel, and the client must provide informed consent to the agreement, all of which must be in writing. In addition, the terms of the agreement must be substantively "fair and reasonable" to the client.

The concern is that the attorney's financial interest in the client's property could create a conflict of interest. In theory, both the client and the attorney want the property to increase in value. But in some cases, the attorney's interest in the property could compromise the impartiality of the attorney's advice, if a potential transaction would benefit the client, but harm the attorney's property interest.

## Litigation Finance

Historically, "maintenance" (litigation funded by a disinterested third person), "champerty"[^615461f8] (litigation funding in exchange for a percentage of any recovery), and "barratry"[^1299f2ec] (frivolous litigation) were illegal and tortious. Percy H. Winfield, History of Maintenance and Champerty, 35 L. Q. Rev. 50 (1919). In medieval England, maintenance and champerty were both prohibited by statute, and may also have been prohibited by the common law.[^ae880315] The prohibition was intended to prevent frivolous and abusive litigation. The concern was that nobles would abuse the courts to harass their enemies and extort settlements.

[^615461f8]: The word "champerty" derived from the Old French word "champart," which referred to a feudal lord's claim to a share of the produce of the land worked by a vassal.

[^1299f2ec]: The word "barratry" derived from the Old French word "barater," which meant "to deceive."

[^ae880315]: In practice, the law prohibited champerty, and may have permitted maintenance without champerty.

Until recently, United States courts maintained the prohibition on maintenance and champerty. But people began to question the legitimacy of rules that prevented people from pursuing valid claims simply because they could not pay attorney's fees. First, courts began permitting contingent fee agreements, which are champerty, but limited to lawyers. And then they began permitting litigation finance agreements, which are champerty for everyone.

Contingent fee agreements are literally champerty, because an attorney agrees to fund litigation in exchange for a percentage of the recovery. And litigation finance agreements are champerty squared, because a third party agrees to fund litigation in exchange for a percentage of the recovery. But courts have held that both contingent fees and litigation finance are fine, because they enable people to pursue valid claims.

WHERE DOES THIS GO? third-party supported litigation may not assert the champerty as a defense, but a court may refuse to enforce a champertous agreement even where the defense of champerty has not been asserted.

On October 4, 2012, the website Gawker published a 2 minute excerpt from a 30 minute video of Terry Gene Bollea, better known as "Hulk Hogan," having sex with Heather Clem, the wife of Bollea's friend Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Bollea claimed the video was made without his knowledge or consent, and filed an action against Gawker in Florida state court, alleging an assortment of tort claims. The jury ruled in favor of Bollea, awarding him $115 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. Gawker could not pay the judgment and filed for bankruptcy. After the trial, Peter Thiel disclosed that he had paid millions of dollars to finance Bollea's action, which he described as "one of my greater philanthropic things that I've done." Many people objected to Thiel's role in Bollea's action. Was it maintenance, champerty, or barratry? Should it have been prohibited?

2. In 2003, residents of Lago Agrio, Ecuador filed a class action against Chevron in an Ecuadorian court, alleging that its Lago Agrio oil field had polluted the environment. The plaintiffs were represented by the Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo Mendoza and the American lawyer Steven Donziger, who obtained more than $32 million in litigation funding. The American documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger documented the litigation and released the film Crude in 2009. In 2011, the Ecuadorian court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered Chevron to pay $18 billion in damages. Chevron's lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP noticed that an early version of Crude had featured an ostensibly impartial environmental expert meeting with Donziger before the trial, and subpoenaed Berlinger's outtakes, which provided additional evidence of fraud and corruption. In 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Donziger had used "corrupt means" in the Ecuadorian court and refused to enforce the verdict, and the Second Circuit affirmed. Both New York and the District of Columbia suspended Donziger from the practice of law. Was it improper for Donziger to obtain third-party litigation funding? Did the availability of funding create improper incentives? Are third-party litigation funders in a position to evaluate the legitimacy of the litigation they fund? Should they be?


# 2.8: Organizations as Clients

When an attorney represents an organization, the attorney's client is typically the organization, and only the organization. An attorney may represent any kind of organization, irrespective of its form. Obviously, an attorney may represent an organization that is a legal entity, like a corporation or a limited liability company. But an attorney may also represent an organization that is not a legal entity, like a partnership or an unincorporated association. In all of these cases, the attorney may represent the organization without representing the constituents of the organization.

But an organization is a legal fiction that can act only through its agents. Accordingly, the attorney advises the organization by advising its agents, who make decisions on behalf of the organization, depending on their role in the organization. In other words, attorneys advise organizational clients by advising non-client agents, who make decisions that bind the organizational client.

Of course, the agents of an organizational client may consult with each other before making decisions for the organization. They may individually ask the attorney for advice about how to act on behalf of the organizational client. They may ask the attorney to advise them collectively about the organizational client's options. And they may ask the attorney for advice about the statements, decisions, and actions of other agents.

The attorney must provide legal advice to the agents of an organizational client, in their capacity as agents of that client. But the attorney must always remember that the client is the organization, not the organization's agent. When the attorney advises an agent, the attorney must provide advice for the benefit of the organization, not the agent. And the attorney must ensure that the agents observe their duties to the organization.

Specifically, an attorney representing an organizational client must ensure that its agents act consistently with the interests of the organization, rather than their own interests. If an agent of an organizational client acts or refuses to act in a way that violates a legal obligation to the organization, then the attorney must act to protect the interests of the organization. The attorney should generally report the concern to the management of the organization. In some cases, the attorney may even report confidential information or withdraw from representation, if it is necessary to protect the interests of the organization.

# 2.9: Agents as Clients

In theory, an attorney who represents an organization represents only the organization, and does not represent the organization's agents. However, organizations can act only through their agents, and when attorneys represent organizations, they do so by providing legal advice to the organization's agents, who made decisions on behalf of the organization. Attorneys must convince the organization's agents to hire them. Attorneys must convince the organization's agents to follow their advice. And attorneys must obey the decisions of the organization's agents. It is easy for attorneys representing an organization to see its agents as their clients, rather than the organization itself.

But that is a terrible mistake. When attorneys represent organizations, they must never treat its agents as their clients. They must always represent the interests of the organization, and only the organization. Attorneys representing an organization must always act in the best interest of the organization, and they must ensure that its agents also act in the best interests of the organization. And if the interests of the organization conflict with the interests of its agents, the attorney must always pursue the interests of the organization.

Usually, the interests of an organization and its agents coincide, and the agents pursue the interests of the organization to the best of their ability. But that is not always the case. Sometimes, the interests of an organization and its agents diverge, and the agents pursue their own interests, at the expense of the organization.

Attorneys representing organizations must always be vigilant to ensure that the organization's interests are aligned with the interests of its agents, and that its agents are acting in the organization's interests, rather than their own. For example, if an agent wants to make a transaction on behalf of the organization that will benefit the agent at the organization's expense, the attorney must object. Likewise, if the agent wants to disclose confidential information about the organization that will benefit the agent, but harm the organization, the attorney must object.

## Agents as Quasi-Clients

Attorneys representing an organization must always be careful to ensure that its agents do not become quasi-clients. If an attorney is retained by an organization, then the attorney has an express attorney-client relationship with the organization. But in order to represent an organization, an attorney must provide legal advice to its agents, who will act on the organization's behalf. Accordingly, the attorney must only provide legal advice relating to the interests of the organization, and must not provide legal advice relating to the interests of its agents. In fact, attorneys representing an organization should explicitly inform its agents that they represent the organization, and not its agents. And they should advise the organization's agents to seek outside counsel, if their interests may diverge from the interests of the organization.

In theory, an attorney representing an organization who wants to interview an agent of the organization can prevent the agent from becoming a client by explicitly warning the agent that the attorney represents the organization, and does not represent the agent. This warning is often called an "Upjohn warning" or "corporate Miranda warning," because its purpose is to inform agents of their right to remain silent. After all, an organization cannot force its agents to testify against themselves. But it can fire them, if they refuse to participate in an investigation.

If an attorney representing an organization provides legal advice to an agent of that organization, then the agent may become a quasi-client of the attorney. That is awkward, because it can create a conflict of interest.

## American Bar Association White Collar Crime Committee Working Group Model 

_"Upjohn Warning" or "Corporate Miranda" Warning_

I am a lawyer for Corporation A. I represent only Corporation A, and I do not represent you personally.

I am conducting this interview to gather facts in order to provide legal advice for Corporation A. This interview is part of an investigation to determine the facts and circumstances of X in order to advise Corporation A how best to proceed.

Your communications with me are protected by the attorney-client privilege. But the attorney-client privilege belongs solely to Corporation A, not you. That means Corporation A alone may elect to waive the attorney-client privilege and reveal our discussion to third parties. Corporation A alone may decide to waive the privilege and disclose this discussion to such third parties as federal or state agencies, at its sole discretion, and without notifying you.

In order for this discussion to be subject to the privilege, it must be kept in confidence. In other words, with the exception of your own attorney, you may not disclose the substance of this interview to any third party, including other employees or anyone outside of the company. You may discuss the facts of what happened but you may not discuss this discussion.

Do you have any questions?

Are you willing to proceed?

##### Questions:
