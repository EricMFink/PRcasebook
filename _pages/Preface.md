_It would be idle to assert that there is nothing of selfishness in the pursuit of a profession. But its ideal is not one of individual success in competitive acquisitive activity. And because ideals operate powerfully to shape action, professional activity, even at its worst, is restrained and guided by something better than the desire for money rewards._

— Roscoe Pound, What is a Profession—the Rise of the Legal Profession in Antiquity, 19 Notre Dame L. Rev. 203 (1944).

_The function of the lawyer is to preserve a sceptical relativism in a society hell-bent for absolutes. The worse the society, the more law there will be. In Hell there will be nothing but law and due process will be meticulously observed._ 

— Grant Gilmore, The Ages of American Law 110 (1977). 

_About half the practice of a decent lawyer consists of telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop._

— Philip C. Jessup, 1 Elihu Root 133 (1964).

_We will not at present inquire whether the doctrine which is held on this subject by English lawyers be or be not agreeable to reason and morality; whether it be right that a man should, with a wig on his head, and a band round his neck, do for a guinea what, without those appendages, he would think it wicked and infamous to do for an empire; whether it be right that, not merely believing but knowing a statement to be true, he should do all that can be done by sophistry, by rhetoric, by solemn asseveration, by indignant exclamation, by gesture, by play of features, by terrifying one honest witness, by perplexing another, to cause a jury to think that statement false._

— Thomas Babington Macaulay, Essay on Francis Bacon (1874).

_Justice says ye? I tell ye Hogan's r-right whin he says: 'Justice is blind. ' Blind she is, an' deef an' dumb an' has a wooden leg! Niver again will they dhraw me to a coort. I'll take th' rude justice iv a piece iv lead pipe without costs or th' r-right iv appeal._

— Finley Peter Dunne, Mr. Dooley's Opinions 118 (1901)

_Lawyer—One who protects us against robbers by taking away the temptation._

— H.L. Mencken, A Mencken Chrestomathy (1949).

_LAWYER, n. One skilled in circumvention of the law._

— Ambrose Bierce, The Cynic's Dictionary (1906). 

_The sad thing about lawyers is not that so many of them are stupid, but that so many of them are intelligent. The craft is a great devourer of good men; it sucks in and wastes almost as many as the monastic life consumed in the Middle Ages. There is something about it that is extraordinarily attractive to bright youngsters, especially in the United States. It not only offers the chance of very substantial rewards in money; it also holds out the temptation of a sort of public dignity, with political preferment thrown in for good measure._

— H.L. Mencken, Stewards of Nonsense, American Mercury 35 (Jan. 1928).

**Preface**

Thank you for your interest in *Professional Responsibility: An Open-Access Casebook*. We hope that you find it useful and informative.

This is a free casebook. We believe that law students and others interested in the law should not have to pay the high prices that commercial publishers charge for casebooks. Many others agree, and have created free or low-cost casebooks covering many different areas of the law. Here are some examples:

We noticed that there was no free and open-source casebook available for a professional responsibility class, so we decided to create one.

<img src="/assets/images/image1.png" style="width:5.23438in;height:3.91026in" />

This casebook covers a wide range of different subjects related to the professional responsibility of attorneys. While it is possible to cover all of this material in a three credit-hour course, you may wish to omit some subjects. You may also wish to supplement the materials in this casebook with additional materials. We encourage you to use this casebook in any way that you like.

This casebook is licensed "Creative Commons 0 / No Rights Reserved.” That means that we explicitly disclaim any copyright claim in all of the original elements that we created in writing this casebook and have intentionally placed the casebook in the public domain. Because this casebook is in the public domain, you can use the materials in it in any way that you like, with or without attribution. Of course, the casebook contains many copyrighted elements that belong to other people and that we used pursuant to fair use. Those elements are still protected by copyright.

We hope that this free casebook helps show that it is possible to create teaching materials for legal education in an open-source format. And we hope it makes access to the law governing legal practice more accessible to law students, attorneys, and anyone interested in the regulation of the legal profession.

In closing, we would like to thank our research assistants Nicole Pottinger, Justin Cloyd, Mark Blankenship, Barrett Block, and Renee Wilson. We would also like to thank Cornelius Kearns, Brandon Magner, and Guy Hamilton-Smith for helpful comments.
