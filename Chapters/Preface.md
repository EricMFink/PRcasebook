# Acknowledgments

This book includes material from Bryan L. Frye & Elizabeth Schiller, [Professional Responsibility: An Open-Source Casebook](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/lawfac_book/5/) (2019).

# Editorial Notes

Judicial opinions and other quoted materials have been edited for teaching purposes. For ease of reading, I have largely dispensed with the use of ellipses when omitting internal citations and other passages.

Following the style of Edward Tufte, this book uses marginal notes in place of footnotes. Numbered notes are from the quoted text, with original reference numbers indicated where appropriate. Editor's notes are unnumbered and appear in sans serif type.
