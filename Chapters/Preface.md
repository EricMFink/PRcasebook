# Acknowledgments

This book includes material from Bryan L. Frye & Elizabeth Schiller, [Professional Responsibility: An Open-Source Casebook](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/lawfac_book/5/) (2019).

# Editorial Notes

Judicial opinions and other quoted materials have been edited for teaching purposes. For ease of reading, I have largely dispensed with the use of ellipses when omitting internal citations and other passages.
