# Editorial Notes

Judicial opinions and other quoted materials have been edited for teaching purposes. For ease of reading, I have largely dispensed with the use of ellipses when omitting internal citations and other passages. Also for ease of reading, marginal notes are used in place of footnotes. Numbered notes are from the quoted text, with original reference numbers indicated where appropriate. Editor's notes are unnumbered and appear in sans serif type.
